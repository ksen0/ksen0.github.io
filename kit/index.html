<h2>Kit Kuksenok, PhD</h2>

<p>I've been doing some form of <a href="../code-data-work">code and/or data work</a> since 2006.</p>

<p>I studied Applied Mathematics and Computer Science (BA, 2010) at Oberlin College, and attended graduate school at University of Washington Computer Science & Engineering. For my Master's (2014), I worked in the intersection of machine translation and human-computer interaction; for my PhD (2016), I studied software production practices. Here is where you can find a list of my <a href=../research class='scholar'>reseach publications</a>. I continue to work on CSCW-flavored research projects as an independent scholar.</p>

<p>As of July 2021, I work as a Senior Data Analyst at Klang Games, supporting both user research and business intelligence. Previously, I worked as a software developer, primarily working on internal analytics tools and machine learning applications in production. My current preferred programming language is Python, which I've used since 2016.<p>

<!--<p>From February 2018 to mid-July 2021, I worked an R&D Engineer at jobpal, a B2B conversational agent company, where I mostly worked with natural-language short-form text, mostly in English and German. From February 2020, I led the R&D team; in November 2020, we were acquired by SmartRecruiters.</p>-->


<h2><small>KSEN ZERO</small> (k0)</h2>

<p>I was born in Kiev, Ukraine. I did most of my growing up in the USA (Pittsburgh, Oberlin, Seattle). Since 2016, I have been based in Berlin. I speak English, Russian, Ukrainian, and now also  German. I've studied Japanese and Latin in school, and I've worked on several constructed <a href=https://www.instagram.com/p/B4-8xfLoPfZ/>languages</a> and <a href=https://www.instagram.com/p/CDo9mI8oTce/>scripts</a>.</p>

<p>I have always been making visual art, and I have always been moving. My visual art projects are often an extension of the study of the body. I also practice and teach yoga as a contemplative movement practice.</p>

<p>My background in socio-technical research informs my artistic practice. For example, here is <a href=../speculative-sim>a recent work</a>, based on a 2019 exhibition & performance with an exploratory simulation with Berlin-based artist Sage Jenson.</p>

<p>My code/data work experiences inform my artistic practice, too. For example, I have used (and sometimes made) tools for self-awareness and self-reflection since ~2007. Print/analog examples: <a href=https://ksen0.github.io/do-the-thing/index.html>Should I do the Thing?</a> and <a href=https://ksen0.github.io/art/love-song/index.html>Love-Song to a Future Self</a>. I do not subscribe to lifehacking or the quantified self ethos; rather, I am interested in non-violent approaches that thrive with <a href=../research/>qualitative/imperfect</a> data.</p>
