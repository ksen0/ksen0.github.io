        <h2>Short version</h2>
       
        <p>Kit Kuksenok, PhD is a multi-disciplinary artist and researcher interested in the intersection of technology, society, and the
          body. They use participatory design methods, experimental pedagogy, and data analytics to explore how the unseen internal bodily
          landscape is rendered understandable. Their art/research practice speaks to STS (science and technology studies) theory and
          is animated by contemplative movement practice.</p>

      <p>In the presentation below, I describe how the  different threads of my research and art practice weave together:</p>

        <h2>Long version</h2>
        
        <p>I was born in Kiev, Ukraine. I did most of my growing up in the USA (Pittsburgh, Oberlin, Seattle).
          Since 2016, I have been based in Berlin. I speak English, Russian, Ukrainian, and now also  German.
          I've studied Japanese and Latin in school, and I've worked on several constructed
          <a href=https://www.instagram.com/p/B4-8xfLoPfZ/>languages</a> and <a href=https://www.instagram.com/p/CDo9mI8oTce/>scripts</a>.</p>
        <p>I have always been making visual art, and I have always been moving. My visual art projects are often an extension of the study of the body. I practice and teach yoga as a contemplative movement practice.</p>
        <p>I've been doing some form of <a href="../code-data-work">code and/or data work</a> since 2006.
          I studied Applied Mathematics and Computer Science (BA, 2010) at Oberlin College, and attended graduate school at University of Washington Computer Science
          & Engineering. For my Master's (2014), I worked in the intersection of machine translation and human-computer interaction.
          For my PhD (2016), I studied software production practices. Here is where you can find a list of my <a href=../research class='scholar'>research publications</a>.
          I continue to work on CSCW-flavored research projects as an independent scholar. <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/kuksenok/>I am employed as a data analyst.</a></p>
        
        <p>My background in socio-technical research informs my artistic practice. For example, here is <a href=../speculative-sim>a recent work</a>, based on a 2019 exhibition & performance with an exploratory simulation with Berlin-based artist Sage Jenson.</p>
        <p>My code/data work experiences inform my artistic practice, too. For example, <a href=https://buttondown.email/zero/archive/body-in-time/>I have used (and made, and critiqued) tools for systematic reflection and buildign body knowledge since 2008</a>.
       I do not subscribe to a "self-optimization" ethos; rather, I am interested in non-violent approaches that thrive with the imperfection inherent in the collection of boily data.</p>
