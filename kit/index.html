        <h2>Short version</h2>
<p>Kit Kuksenok, PhD is an earnestcore multi-disciplinary artist, researcher, and transsexual.
  They explore how the unseen interior human body landscape is understood, and use methods including-but-not-limited-to:
  drawing, dance, participatory performance, speculative fiction, games, singing, contemplative breathwork and movement,
  corporate drag, autotheory, <a href=https://becoming-magazine.com/automatic-gender-recognition>hallucinatory self-portraiture</A>, and experimental pedagogy.</p>

<!--        <p>Kit Kuksenok, PhD is a multi-disciplinary artist and researcher interested in the intersection of technology, society, and the
          body. They use participatory design methods, experimental pedagogy, and data analytics to explore how the unseen internal bodily
          landscape is rendered understandable. Their art/research practice builds on the study of socio-technical systems, and
          is grounded in contemplative practice and movement.</p>-->

        <h2>Long version</h2>

        <p>I was born in Kyiv, Ukraine. I did most of my growing up in the USA (Pittsburgh, Oberlin, Seattle).
          Since 2016, I have been based in Berlin. I speak English, Russian, Ukrainian, and now also  German.
          I've studied Japanese and Latin in school, and I've worked on several constructed
          <a href=https://www.instagram.com/p/B4-8xfLoPfZ/>languages</a> and <a href=https://www.instagram.com/p/CDo9mI8oTce/>scripts</a>.</p>
        <p>I have always been making visual art, and I have always been moving. My visual art projects are often an extension of the study of the body. I practice and teach yoga asana, which influences both how I teach technical subjects, and the art/performance landscape I am most interest in exploring.</p>
        <p>I've been doing some form of <a href="https://ksen0.github.io/code-data-work/">code and/or data work</a> since 2006.
          I studied Applied Mathematics and Computer Science (BA, 2010) at Oberlin College, and attended graduate school at University of Washington Computer Science
          & Engineering. For my Master's (2014), I worked in the intersection of machine translation and human-computer interaction.
          For my PhD (2016), I studied software production practices. Here is where you can find a list of my <a href=../research class='scholar'>research publications</a>.
          I continue to work on CSCW-flavored research projects as an independent scholar. <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/kuksenok/>I am employed as a data analyst.</a></p>

        <p>My background in socio-technical research informs my artistic practice. For example, here is <a href=../speculative-sim>work</a>, based on a 2019 exhibition & performance with an exploratory simulation with Berlin-based artist Sage Jenson.</p>
        <p>My code/data work experiences inform my artistic practice, too. I have used (and made, and critiqued) <a href=https://ksen0.medium.com/time-energy-management-for-creative-projects-941505257b7f>tools for systematic reflection</a> and building body knowledge since 2008.
       I do not subscribe to a "self-optimization" ethos; rather, I am interested in <a href=https://criticalcode.recipes/contributions/critical-data-practice-at-home-and-with-friends>non-violent approaches that thrive with the imperfection inherent in the collection of bodily data and question the mechanisms of this collection</a>.</p>
