<h2>Kit Kuksenok, PhD</h2>

<p>I've been doing some form of <a href="../code">code work</a> since 2005 (when I taught, as a teaching assistant, the intro to programming in Java at Carnegie Mellon's Andrew's Leap program for high school students).</p>

<p>For my Master's, I worked in the intersection of machine translation and human-computer interaction; for my PhD, I studied software production practices.  Here is where you can find my <a href=../cv.pdf class='scholar'>research CV</a> or <a href=https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=BT54SFsAAAAJ class='scholar'>scientific publications</a>.</p>

<p>Since February 2018, I am senior R&D engineer at jobpal Ltd, where I mostly work with natural-language short-form text, mostly in English and German.</p>

<h2><small>KSEN ZERO</small> (k0)</h2>
<p>I was born in Kiev, Ukraine. I did most of my growing up in the USA (Pittsburgh, Oberlin, Seattle). Since 2016, I have been based in Berlin. I speak English, Russian, Ukrainian, and now also a middling amount of German. I've studied Japanese and Latin in school, and I've made several constructed <a href=https://www.instagram.com/p/B4-8xfLoPfZ/>languages</a> and <a href=https://www.instagram.com/p/CDo9mI8oTce/>scripts</a>.</p>

<p>I have always been making visual art, and I have always been moving. Currently, I make mostly <a href=https://www.instagram.com/xn_ze_ro/>digital abstract art about the body</a>.</p>

<p>My background in socio-technical research informs my artistic practice. For example, here is <a href=https://2020.xcoax.org/pdf/xCoAx2020-Jenson.pdf>a recent work</a>, based on a 2019 exhibition & performance with an exploratory simulation with Berlin-based artist Sage Jenson.</p>

<p>My code/data work experiences inform my artistic practice, too. For example, I have used (and sometimes made) tools for self-awareness and self-reflection since ~2007. Print/analog examples: <a href=https://ksen0.github.io/do-the-thing/index.html>Should I do the Thing?</a> and <a href=https://ksen0.github.io/art/love-song/index.html>Love-Song to a Future Self</a>. I do not subscribe to lifehacking or the quantified self ethos; rather, I am interested in non-violent approaches that thrive with <a href=https://medium.com/ok-work/the-gentle-calibration-of-the-qualified-self-59aa3c7d1900>qualitative/imperfect</a> data.</p>
