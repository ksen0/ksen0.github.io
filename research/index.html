      <h3>Data Body (2020 - present)</h3>

      <p>Through personal practice and collaborative research, I'm studying tools and methods for constructing a data body. As part of this research, I teach practice-based, critical courses through Berlin's School of Machines, Making and Make-Believe, making the project of "self-tracking" a collective endeavor. Together, multi-disciplinary visual artist Marisa Satsia and I have been studying the re-use and repurposing of technologies (both medical and consumer) for observing the human bodily experience. We are especially  mobilizing visual art practices for subversive body projects.<br>Read more: <a href=http://databody.art><strong>http://databody.art</strong></a></p>

      <p>Presented at xCoAx2021: "Know thy Flesh: What Multi-disciplinary Contemporary Art Teaches Us about Building Body Knowledge" co-authored research article with Marisa.<br><strong><a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9XhjQtPQoA>Watch our talk recording online...</a></strong></p>

      <h3>Speculative Simulation (2018 - present)</h3>
      <p>Artist <a href=https://www.sagejenson.com/>Sage Jenson</a> and I have investigated <a href="../speculative-sim">the locus of agency in a simulated system for live performance</a> as part of an ongoing collaboration. Our research explores ways to craft intutitive, emotionally-evocative experiences of complex systems that model natural phenomena:</p>

      <blockquote>"The goal of our generative art is to render observable the inner space
of complex biological systems that are pervasive in the world, vital to
understand, and difficult to grasp."<br>(<a href=https://revistas.ucp.pt/index.php/jsta/article/view/9489>our 2020 JSTA article</a>)</blockquote>

      <h3>Code Work (2014 - present)</h3>
      <p>How does change happen in technical teams? and when/why doesn't it? After writing my PhD dissertation on code work practices among oceanographers, I have continued to think about it from <a href=https://ksen0.github.io/code-data-work/>the perspective of a coder</a>. As originally intended, the ethnographic study I finished in 2016 will be revisited ~10-15 years later (so, 2026-31), at which point I plan to update and refine some of those theoretical ideas based on new theory in the field; personal reflections; and new empirical data.</p>
      <p>You can watch the last academic talk I gave on the topic <a href=http://www.tele-task.de/archive/lecture/overview/9630>here</a>; the audience was mostly software architecture/engineering researchers and practitioners and it followed a post-doctoral fellowship at the Software Architecture group at Hasso Plattner Institute. It was on <a href=http://www.tele-task.de/archive/lecture/overview/9630>Usability, Use and Reuse of Software Services</a>, and I presented the case for a taking human-centered approach to understanding resistance to new tools/skills (even when everyone agrees the new things are a good idea).</p>
