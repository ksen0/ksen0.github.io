      <h3>Data Body (2020 - present)</h3>

      <p>Through personal practice and collaborative research, I'm studying tools and methods for constructing a data body. As part of this research, I teach practice-based, critical courses through Berlin's School of Machines, Making and Make-Believe, making the project of "self-tracking" a collective endeavor.</p>
      <p><a href=http://schoolofma.org/radical-imperfection>Radical Impefection in Time Tracking</a> <em>(Feb-Mar 2021)</em> We use collection, analysis, and exploration of personal data as a site of institutional and cultural phenomena, reviewing topics in self-improvement ethos and biopower and the gendered valuation of labor. We apply each of the <a href=https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/data-feminism>Data Feminism</a> principles, and the fundamental information visualization techniques, to working with our own data about time (including, but not limited to, time spent in various creative pursuits.) Through expressive, artistic sketches of our own data, we dismantle the presumed/supposed neutrality and precision of data - especially data collected by technologies employing rhetorics of objectivity.</p>
      <p><a href=http://schoolofma.org/radical-imperfection>Radical Impefection in Self Tracking</a> <em>(Nov-Dec 2020)</em> Critical perspectives on self-tracking through sensors and wearables, and collaborative exploration of ways to reconfigure technology for sustainable and transformative systematic reflection practices. We covered technologies involved in tracking of sleep, movement, and emotion/mood - all of which pose distinct challenges.
      </p>

      <p><em>(More materials about the courses <a href=https://www.are.na/kit-kuksenok/radical-imperfection>here</a>.)</em></p>

      <p>Multi/inter-disciplinary visual artist/researcher <a href=https://www.instagram.com/medartcabinet/>Marisa Satsia</a> and I are exploring the re-use and repurposing of technologies (both medical and consumer) for observing the human bodily experience. We are interested especially in mobilizing visual art practices for  <a href=https://www.are.na/block/10744802>subversive body projects.</a></p>

      <!--<p>In my next work, I want to consider multi-media narratives (video, image, poetry, zine, voice messages, collage, etc) used by transgender people in the course of experiencing gender-affirming changes (internal or external! Interpret this as you like). I am interested in many aspects of these practices, but especially the community roles of these narratives. This is in the early stages, but if this idea resonates with you and you would like to get involved, <a href=https://www.instagram.com/xn_ze_ro/>I would love to hear from you</a>.</p>-->

      <h3>Speculative Simulation (2018 - present)</h3>
      <p>Artist <a href=https://www.sagejenson.com/>Sage Jenson</a> and I have investigated <a href="../speculative-sim">the locus of agency in a simulated system for live performance</a> as part of an ongoing collaboration. Our research explores ways to craft intutitive, emotionally-evocative experiences of complex systems that model natural phenomena:</p>

      <blockquote>"The goal of our generative art is to render observable the inner space
of complex biological systems that are pervasive in the world, vital to
understand, and difficult to grasp."<br>(<a href=https://revistas.ucp.pt/index.php/jsta/article/view/9489>our 2020 JSTA article</a>)</blockquote>

      <h3>Code Work (2014 - present)</h3>
      <p>How does change happen in technical teams? and when/why doesn't it? After writing my PhD dissertation on code work practices among oceanographers, I have continued to think about it from <a href=https://ksen0.github.io/code-data-work/>the perspective of a coder</a>. As originally intended, the ethnographic study I finished in 2016 will be revisited ~10-15 years later (so, 2026-31), at which point I plan to update and refine some of those theoretical ideas based on new theory in the field; personal reflections; and new empirical data.</p>
      <p>You can watch the last academic talk I gave on the topic <a href=http://www.tele-task.de/archive/lecture/overview/9630>here</a>; the audience was mostly software architecture/engineering researchers and practitioners and it followed a post-doctoral fellowship at the Software Architecture group at Hasso Plattner Institute. It was on <a href=http://www.tele-task.de/archive/lecture/overview/9630>Usability, Use and Reuse of Software Services</a>, and I presented the case for a taking human-centered approach to understanding resistance to new tools/skills (even when everyone agrees the new things are a good idea).</p>
