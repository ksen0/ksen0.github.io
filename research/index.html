    <!--<p>I'm interested in <strong>care</strong> and <strong>repair</strong> work in socio-technical systems.</p>-->
    <p>I study how people use technology through (1) quantitative data analysis, including natural language processing, or NLP; (2) qualitative methods, including interview and observation; and (3) artistic intervention, including performance and participatory artwork.</p>

    <h3>2014-2023: <em>Code Work</em> & Change in Software Teams</h3>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> I am in the process of integrating this past academic work with subsequent experience doing and leading software work in industry settings. I have taught the resulting workshop, "Sharing Programming Knowledge," at varia (Rotterdam, NL; April 1, 2023); at Curve Labs (Berlin, DE; March 16, 2023) and at Phiture, GmbH (Berlin, DE; February 27, 2023). I am very excited to continue to develop and share this body of work in the coming years.</p>

      <blockquote><small><strong>How does change happen in technical teams? and when/why doesn't it?</strong>
        <!--After writing my PhD dissertation on code work practices among oceanographers, I have continued to think about it from <a href=https://ksen0.github.io/code-data-work/>the perspective of a coder</a>. As originally intended, the ethnographic study I finished in 2016 will be revisited ~10-15 years later (so, 2026-31), at which point I plan to update and refine some of those theoretical ideas based on new theory in the field; personal reflections; and new empirical data.</p>-->
     You can watch the last academic talk I gave on the topic <a href=http://www.tele-task.de/archive/lecture/overview/9630>here</a>; the audience was mostly software architecture/engineering researchers and practitioners and it followed a post-doctoral fellowship at the Software Architecture group at Hasso Plattner Institute. It was on <a href=http://www.tele-task.de/archive/lecture/overview/9630>Usability, Use and Reuse of Software Services</a>, and I presented the case for a taking human-centered approach to understanding resistance to new tools/skills (even when everyone agrees the new things are a good idea).<br><br>

              <blockquote><small>Do you do code work for some data-driven or AI system? How much time do you spend cleaning data? If you answer "too much", shake your head, or feel kind of frustrated or ambivalent about it, I invite you to
                imagine a perfect world, with respect to how code/data systems are designed, developed, and maintained. Consider: how much time do you spend cleaning data in this perfect world, and how do you feel about it?</small></blockquote>

Edited by Yuefang Zhou, Martin H. Fischer. In Print (2018)
          <blockquote><small>Can technology engage humans in experiences of mutual intimacy? Overwhelmingly, what prevents mutual disclosure and vulnerability is not the technical capacity of an individual technological object, but rather the organisational constraints of that object’s production. Although we consider sex robots as a specific case study, our investigation includes anything that can be read as intimate: anything that sits in your home and talks to you. Talking is key, and the history of conversational agents starts as early as the 1960s with ELIZA. We see conversation as the primary means that a technological object asserts itself as a coherent unit; at the same time, from a technological perspective it is (and, arguably, must be) a multi-component architecture, a fractured and distributed self essentially obscured from the person with whom it interacts.</small></blockquote>
