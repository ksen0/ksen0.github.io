	I was living in Seattle from 2010-2016, while I worked on my PhD at the University of Washington. This is a photo of my almost-daily walk throguh campus to the building. The mountain (Rainier) is not always out, but when it is, no one can stop being excited about it.

	Seattle is really beautiful. This is kayaking in Lake Union, which is also a short walk from the University.

	The day trips, or hiking/camping trips, though sometimes rainy, were wonderful and memorable.
	</p>

	The streams and lakes in the mountains are gorgeous, but rocky and cold.

	Going east from Seattle, toward the Cascades, is less rainy, more deserty, more colorful in the fall.

	The West Coast of the US more generally is a spectacular place.

	A few times I was in California for conferences, particularly twice in Asilomar near Monterey Bay, and it was one of the more beautiful places I'd ever been.

	Mainly, I used my bike and public transit to get around the Pacific Northwest. This is from a trip with a friend to Vancouver Island.

	During the field data collection phase of my dissertation, I travelled to Vancouver every few weeks, by bike and bus. Ths became one of my favorite stops: the coffee shack in Bellingham where the bus made a 20-minute stop. Enough to grab a coffee and a breakfast burrito. Some of my best writing took place on those 6A.M. breakfast-burrito-fuelled bus rides.

	Aside from the university and the outdoors, I spent a lot of time discovering myself as a writer. The Hugo House is a particularly beloved landmark for the writing community. This actual house has been demolished now and the community is based in a different, nearby building. I was lucky that before I left Seattle, I could attend the farewell event, write on the walls, and remember with everyone else what this place meant to us.

	I moved from Seattle to Berlin in 2016, mailing some boxes of particularly expensive or personally-meaningful items, and otherwise relying on the backpacks.
	</p>
</div>

<div class="tile">
	<img src="TRAVEL-BUDAPEST2.jpg"><p>
	A lot of people ask me why I moved to Berlin. It is clear why I moved to the US in 2001: My parents got jobs in Pittsburgh. It is clear why I moved to Seattle in 2010: I got a great offer at a top University. But Berlin was not connected to work. In 2014, I travelled around Europe and Eastern Europe (the photo is from that trip, from Budapest) and Berlin stood out as a place I might want to live.

	It was a happy conincidence, then, that a most intriguing man I met while travelling in Turkey happened to be living in Berlin. We're married now. This is us forging our engagement/wedding rings at the Chaos Communication Camp in 2015.

	<img src="TRAVEL-ISTANBUL2.jpg"><p>
	I met Heinrich in Istanbul when I was meeting up with a friend for further travel. We had a nice conversation and way too much coffee in this place, which had just opened then, so the owner was extremely excited, and gave us a lot of (highly caffeinnated) samples of various fancy coffee machine results. We took a selfie then but it was shaky, because of too much coffee. This photo is from a recent trip I made to Istanbul alone.

I think the discomfort of air travel only rarely manages to undermine how basicallz amazing it is.
