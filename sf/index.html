<h1>SF</h1>

<div class="txt">Hi! I'm Kit, and I work with sci-fi and speculative fiction as a <a href=http://xnze.ro>technologist, teacher</a>, and writer. <em>I use the term SF widely, through in my view one essential aspect of SF is some degree of worldbuilding, and commitment to the world that has been built - even if it is not explained, or explained through a confused or limited character.<br/><br/>As <a href=https://yalereview.org/article/samuel-r-delany-science-fiction-why-i-write>Samuel R. Delany writes:</a> "You can put together more intersting combinations of words in science fiction than you can in any other kind of writing—and they actually mean something. You can say things like, “The door dilated” … and it implies both design and technology, as well as whole sets of social and experiential differences. When you say things like, “Her world exploded,” [you] reserve the margin for the words to mean that a planet belonging to a woman blew up."</em><br/><br/>It is such <strong>poetics of the literal</strong> that most draw me to SF, in literature and games alike, as well as in crafting performances with machine collaborators.</div>

<h1>Teaching</h1>

<div class="txt">Algorithmic Poetry of Fictional Robotics (<a href=https://www.schoolofma.org/programs/p/early2024-algorithmic-poetry-fictional-robotics>March 5 - April 2, 2024</a>) <em>How have historical developments in robotics, speculative fiction, and algorithmic poetry influenced our understanding of the present and the future?<br/><br/>In collaboration with <a href=https://mario-guzman.com/>Mario Guzman</a>, I teach speculative fiction at Berlin's School of Machines, Making, and Make-Believe since 2023. I also previously taught a course on <a href=https://ko-fi.com/s/c1c300f28e>worldbuilding</a> in SF more generally.</em></div>

<h1>Performance</h1>

<h2>Creatures</h2>

<div class="txt">Ongoing collaboration with <a href=https://www.samanthatiussi.com/>Samantha Tiussi</a>, in which we explore collaborative performance with <a href=https://www.samanthatiussi.com/creatures>glass creatures</a> through partial automation.</div>

<div class="txt">Together with <a href=https://www.sagejenson.com/>Sage Jenson</a>, who developed the interactive simulation based on the slime mold Physarum Polycephalum, I performed and exhibited visual art in <a href=https://www.sagejenson.com/dismantling-2019>Dismantling</a> (2019) @ Workshop on Forster, Berlin.</div>

Digital ink allows the scribe to </em>intentionally
shift agency between themselves and the simulation; and to engage with the simulated
system agency at a level of complexity and scale inaccessible in a physical handwriting
medium.<em>" (Jenson & Kuksenok, 2020)</em></div>

<h1>Games</h1>


<div class="txt"><a href=https://k0.games/dwell/>Dwell</a> (2023) is a short collaborative storytelling game, where the end of the story is already known, but the way there must be decided through <a href=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ihIC2QvzWMI8ZjtGcHVL8cR2EtsU-E4UmwG17qmk3Aw/edit#heading=h.rk65dzhpw0en>turn-based gameplay</a>.

<div class="txt"><a href=https://troublebook.club/>Lost Mail</a> (2018-2020) was a monthly mystery space-postage detritus puzzle, run in collaboration with <a href=https://www.coraleecreates.com/>Cora Lee</a>. <em>All materials are currently offline, while I develop an interactive web-based story based on this puzzle. However, as a sneak peak, here is a diagram of a constructed language using moss, lichen, and tiny creatures that some rocks use to speak to each other in that world:</em></div>
