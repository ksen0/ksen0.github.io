    Do you remember websites? Like, websites about a particular person's very
    specific selection of hobbies plus maybe a pet? "Welcome to my website!
    Here you can find everything you need to know about succulents. Also
    here is my dog, Beatrice; and last weekend I made a very good soup,
    so here is the recipe for that too."

    Those websites were magic. Those "under construction" gifs* would dazzle
    the viewer, and the long ranty zero-SEO content would have a fertile
    ground in which to blossom.

    So!

    Welcome to my website.

    It's under construction.

    I like charts, flowcharts, little graphics, just, that stuff. You can
    find some of that here. I don't have a dog. But here is some pretty A+
    soup you can make (it's a variation on Ukrainian borscht - and if you
    make it, and someone is like, "that's not authentic" you can tell them
    a Ukrainian told you to make it like this and anyway there are as many
    authentic borscht recipe as there are Ukrainians):


    Ingredients, for basically half a week's supply, so, beware:
    - Potatoes (like 5 or 10 depending on your enthusiasm for potatoes)
    - Can of black beans (or you can make em fresh up to you)
    - 1 large beer root or 2 medium ones. We do not discuss the small ones
    - Chicken wings (or legs), like 6-12, if you're a meat-eater

    Start by peeling and chopping up some potatoes into whatever
    size feels alright for a soup. I would cut a medium potato in about 6
    pieces.

    Start a big ol' pot of water half-filled.

    The rest is Under Construction, as of Jan 2019.


    -------------------------------- FAQ ----------------------------------

    Q: Why rainbows? Are you queer?
    A: _So_ queer! Ask me about it in person, especially if you're feeling
       like there are things that are important to you as a human, that
       matter in your work environment, but that you're not sure how to
       bring up in that work environment. I am by no means an expert, but
       I can tell you about how coming out professionally was for me, and
       what I learned, and you can decide whether/how you want to learn
       from that. Just remember: it's okay to be a little unsure. It's
       okay to explore. Please do everything you need to take care of
       yourself. 

    Q: What is it like to be a woman in tech?
    A: Please follow up with me in a private channel, and I'll point you to
       resources related to specific things you are interested in! I've
       done outreach and diversity volunteering, mostly in academia, to
       improve inclusiveness in tech. This is what I draw from; personally,
       I don't identify as a woman, so I cannot say much from my own POV
       what being a woman in tech is. But I am asked this a lot, because
       people think I look like a woman, and my only recommendation is:
       try to ask this less. If you want to ask this, try asking:
       "What can I do to improve inclusiveness in our field?"
       or something to this effect.

    Q: Oh no! I used the wrong pronouns! and/or I asked you the woman in
       tech thing and now I feel crappy! Sooooorrrrrryyyyyy!
    A: We are all operating on assumptions that we draw from the society
       and environment in which we are embedded. This is not something
       to be sorry about; you don't need to apologize or feel guilty,
       although that is a real feeling. I'm transgender and it's not
       like I'm immune to occasioanlly using the wrong pronoun for my
       transgender friends or colleagues; when I do, the impulse is to
       apologize. But upon reflection, I feel like rather than be sorry,
       I want to channel my energy to being better next time. Rather
       than, "how can I move on from this discomfort?" I try to ask,
       "how can I accept this discomfort, and learn from it?"
