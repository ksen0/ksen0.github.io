Hi there, nice of you to check the source code!

I used to do some web development work on a freelance or part-time basis around 2005-2010, and it's been amazing to see the developments in front-end work. I did briefly maintain a react.js website (redux) for a few months in 2018 while the team I was on looked for a front-end developer, but ultimately I only use vanilla JavaScript (and sometimes p5.js) in occasional personal projects.

For example, here is some interactive art I made for an exhibition with Elly Clarke: https://k0.games/howareyou/v1/ - try typing for a while:)

Currently, I am also very interested in regulation around data and issues of data privacy online - as well as excess in computing more generally - and I use no data collection of any kind in any of my projects.

  <h1>Kit Kuksenok</h1>

  <p><strong>Hello!</strong> I'm a artist, writer, and coder. I work as p5.js Lead at the Processing Foundation. You can connect with me via <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/kuksenok>LinkedIn</a>; via <a href="https://www.instagram.com/xn_ze_ro/">IG/@xn_ze_ro</a>; or using the contact form below.</p>

  <h2>Bio</h2>

  <p>Kit Kuksenok is an artist, writer, and coder. Since first learning to code in 2002, they have worked as a systems integrator, web developer, software engineer, data analyst, and lecturer in computer science. Their art is informed by this proximity to technology and its variegated uses, exploring through images and performance how body data collection (voluntary and otherwise) influences the collective understanding and imagination of unseen body structures and processes. Recently, Kit has chaired the "Body Imaginations" track at the Politics of the Machines (2024) conference; and published the artist book "How Do We Know What We Know About Hormones?" (2023) with HumDrum Press based on their 2022 artist/research residency within the school of commons (ZHdK), and initially inspired by their experiences of technological/medical mediation of transsexuality. <!--Their writing has also appeared in the Posthumanist magazine and (pseudonymously as i0 xen0) in various digital and physical publications of Berlin-based becoming.press.--> They hold a MSci (2014) and PhD (2016) in Computer Science and Engineering from the University of Washington (Seattle); they have also learned a great deal from the creative writing communities at Hugo House (Seattle) and the Reader (Berlin), as well as from practicing and teaching yoga. Born in Ukraine, and having lived both in the US and in Germany, Kit speaks English, Ukrainian, Russian, and some German.

  </ul>


    <p>Adoption, adaptation, and refusal of technology within work teams has been an interest since my <a href=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10606-017-9285-x>PhD research</a> at the University of Washington (Seattle). Over the past decade, I have expanded my knowledge of organizational change and technological adaptation through experience as a software engineer and data analyst; and through further training at the Hertie School (Berlin) as part of my in-progress MPA. Some of my work contributed to peer-reviewed publications that can be viewed on my <a href=https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=RHUsOhEAAAAJ>Google Scholar</a> and <a href=https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5118-4044>ORCiD</a> profiles.</p>
    <p>I've engaged with, both critically and constructively, with technology-mediated self-optimization within the <a href="https://www.bask.guide/">body data</a> art/research, but also within the context of individual <a href="https://ksen0.medium.com/time-energy-management-for-creative-projects-941505257b7f">time management</a> and <a href="https://ksen0.github.io/do-the-thing">decision-making</a>. These were very active topics within my practice 2008-2021; now, my personal findings boil down to the following. Some self-monitoring can be a kind of accessibility aid: helping with challenges of, for example, executive dysfunction, or chronic illness management. Both my personal and <a href=https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=RHUsOhEAAAAJ&citation_for_view=RHUsOhEAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C>research</a> interests in this topic were always initially grounded in how technology can meet access needs. However, that positive application does not negate the essential violence of self-monitoring. Therefore, measurement should only be done once there is a concept of "enough:" do we only measure for a limited time? Do we only measure a qualitative measure of "good enough"? It takes discipline to do self-monitoring, and it also takes discipline to stop. In my personal experience, both disciplines are equally important.</p>
    <p>More recent work (2019-2024) on body data has explored <a href="https://www.bask.guide/hormones/">collective storytelling and drawing</a> and illegible representations of body data. In WIP series of web-based interactive digital works, I explore temporalities captured by body data, or suggested by complex systems. The <a href="https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1083158">earliest of these works</a> (press play to exit "tutorial" mode) take on elements of traditional visualization design and explore representations of uncertainty, in particular through the introduction of animated jitter, referencing the work of Jessica Hullman in particular, but also other approaches from Data Feminism as an approach to processing and representation of data. More <a href=https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1929038>complex-systems explorations</a> are less representative, and rather are inscriptions of specific bodily processes, in this example the O2-CO2 exchange in the blood, with color and animation creating a sense of becoming out of breath. This builds on the idea of autographic visualization - ie, a thing embodying its own temporal process in itself, like the rings of a tree inscribing its own history - which I use a curatorial concept in this <a href=https://www.are.na/i0-xen0/energy-trace>are.na channel</a>.</p>

  <h1>Technical Training for Teams</h1>
 <img src="2023-varia-workshop.png" style="width:200px;float:left">




  <p>The topic of organizational change, and how a group can adapt new technologies to their work, was <a href=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10606-017-9285-x>the subject of my PhD</a>. Over the last decade, I have  expanded my knowledge of organizational change and technological adaptation through experience as a software engineer and data analyst; and through coursework and training within my current master's program. Since 2010, I have worked with/in various teams in the tech industry, working primarily on B2B applications with/at: AT&T Labs, Google, Facebook, Amazon.com, jobpal Ltd (acquired by SmartRecruiters), Phiture GmbH (Berlin), Curve Labs (Berlin), varia (Rotterdam), Klang Games (Berlin), School of Commons (Zurich), and others, including through consulting work. Some of my work contributed to peer-reviewed publications that can be viewed on my <a href=https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=RHUsOhEAAAAJ>Google Scholar</a> and <a href=https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5118-4044>ORCiD</a> profiles.</p>

  <p>Get in touch if you're interested in a tailored workshop, which bridges both technical and non-technical work, on a topic such as:</p>

  <ul>
  <li><strong>Sharing Technical Knowledge</strong> How can an organization or team (big or small) build a culture of effective knowledge sharing and documentation? What are the current barriers and challenges, and how to overcome them in a sustainable way?</li>
    <li><strong>Navigating Technical Change</strong> How to effectively innovation & integrate emerging technologies, including AI, into established processes? What is the most ligthweight and practical way to ensure the reliability of a product that is in active development, or that relies on third-party tools that can significantly change over time? <!--What approach to validation, testing, and monitoring that best supports the organization in its current stage, with its actual needs and capabilities?This is a in-depth, facilitated workshop that supports collaborative innovation and exchange within a specific team, and is tailored to their  <strong><em>specific technical needs</em></strong> and interests. The workshop can take the form of a single full-day session, or over a longer timeframe in shorter sessions.</li>
  <li><strong>Multilingual Support with AI</strong> Today's tools for natural-language understanding and generation are very good and getting better, but there are persistent challenges in supporting multiple languages. This is especially important to consider when the languages supported are not languages spoken within the organization or team, so there is greater reliance on an (imperfect, though good) AI tool. I have worked on machine translation within my MSci (2014) and since then have extensively worked with automated analysis of text, both building models, and using third-party solutions. I have also built and used chatbots since 2018, most recently working with using generative AI tools for app marketing.</li>
  <li><strong>Actionable User Research</strong> Based on industry and academic experience <a href=https://medium.com/hci-design-at-uw/how-i-do-user-research-fabc89acc7c9>conducting user research</a>, both through qualitative (interviews and ethnography) and quantitative (surveys and analysis of user-generated data), I have helped teams building consumer technology make the most of user research and uncover actionable insights.</li>
    <li><strong>Diversity in Hiring</strong> This workshop focuses specifically at the tools and processes used throughout hiring, and how they can more effectively support inclusive and equitable practices during the entire hiring process, from sourcing, to interviewing, to onboadring. Drawing on my knowledge of talent acquisition technologies, metrics, and practices; and training on inclusion in digital organizations. </li>
  </ul>
