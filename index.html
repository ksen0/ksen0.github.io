    Do you remember websites? Like, websites about a particular person's very
    specific selection of hobbies plus maybe a pet? "Welcome to my website!
    Here you can find everything you need to know about succulents. Also
    here is my dog, Beatrice; and last weekend I made a very good soup,
    so here is the recipe for that too."

    Those websites were magic. Those "under construction" gifs* would dazzle
    the viewer, and the long ranty zero-SEO content would have a fertile
    ground in which to blossom.

    * http://textfiles.com/underconstruction/

    So!

    Welcome to my website.

    It's under construction.

    I like charts, flowcharts, little graphics, just, that stuff. You can
    find some of that here. I don't have a dog. But here is some pretty A+
    soup you can make (it's a variation on Ukrainian borscht - and if you
    make it, and someone is like, "that's not authentic" you can tell them
    a Ukrainian told you to make it like this and anyway there are as many
    authentic borscht recipe as there are Ukrainians):


    Ingredients, for basically half a week's supply, so, beware:
    - Potatoes (like 5 or 10 depending on your enthusiasm for potatoes)
    - Can of black beans (or you can make em fresh up to you)
    - 1 large beer root or 2 medium ones. We do not discuss the small ones
    - Chicken wings (or legs), like 6-12, if you're a meat-eater

    Start by peeling and chopping up some potatoes into whatever
    size feels alright for a soup. I would cut a medium potato in about 6
    pieces.

    Start a big ol' pot of water half-filled.

    The rest is Under Construction, as of Jan 2019.


    -------------------------------- FAQ ----------------------------------

    Q: Why rainbows? Are you queer?
    A: _So_ queer! Ask me about it in person, especially if you're feeling
       like there are things that are important to you as a human, that
       matter in your work environment, but that you're not sure how to
       bring up in that work environment. I am by no means an expert, but
       I can tell you about how coming out professionally was for me, and
       what I learned, and you can decide whether/how you want to learn
       from that. Just remember: it's okay to be a little unsure. It's
       okay to explore. The world is lighter with your authentic, sincere
       self in it; when you choose to be vulnerable, that is a wonderful
       gift. Sometimes people can be angry when they deny themselves the
       joy of authenticity, and they see someone who is being themselves.
       That pain and anger is also real and valid, because all feelings
       are valid, but being valid doesn't mean it's good, or entitled to
       your life energy. Please do everything you need to take care of
       yourself. If you feel like you have no one to help you navigate
       this, please, please, please reach out to me. I will try my best
       to find you resources, to listen to you, and to share any of my
       own experiences that you might find valuable.

    Q: What is it like to be a woman in tech?
    A: Please follow up with me in a private channel, and I'll point you to
       resources related to specific things you are interested in! I've
       done outreach and diversity volunteering, mostly in academia, to
       improve inclusiveness in tech. This is what I draw from; personally,
       I don't identify as a woman, so I cannot say much from my own POV
       what being a woman in tech is. But I am asked this a lot, because
       people think I look like a woman, and my only recommendation is:
       try to ask this less. If you want to ask this, try asking:
       "What can I do to improve inclusiveness in our field?"
       or something ot this effect.

    Q: Oh no! I used the wrong pronouns! and/or I asked you the woman in
       tech thing and now I feel crappy! Sooooorrrrrryyyyyy!
    A: We are all operating on assumptions that we draw from the society
       and environment in which we are embedded. This is not something
       to be sorry about; you don't need to apologize or feel guilty,
       although that is a real feeling. I'm transgender and it's not
       like I'm immune to occasioanlly using the wrong pronoun for my
       transgender friends or colleagues; when I do, the impulse is to
       apologize. But upon reflection, I feel like rather than be sorry,
       I want to channel my energy to being better next time. Rather
       than, "how can I move on from this discomfort?" I try to ask,
       "how can I accept this discomfort, and learn from it?"

    --------------------------------- <3 ----------------------------------

    Love is like running.
    It is only hard when you're out of practice.
    Practice it every moment you can.
    There aren't any prerequisites.
    Just go for it.
    The more you do it,
    the easier it comes,
    the more it energizes
    rather than drains.

    I love you.

    If I don't know you,
    that doesn't stop me from loving you.

    Don't you see: people hate without knowing all the time.
    Sometimes it seems like we need to
    "know" or
    "understand"
    in order to love.
    But I haven't found that to be
    at all
    necessary.

    --------------------------------- PS ----------------------------------

    The above is a personal note that was inspired by the writer Jeffrey
    Marsh and their uplifting social media content. Feel free to follow
    them on the platfor mof your choice, for regular messages of love
    and care:

    http://www.jeffreymarsh.com/
    https://www.instagram.com/thejeffreymarshs
    https://twitter.com/thejeffreymarsh

    They also have a book out, which I haven't read. On the subject of
    love, I am still working through bell hooks' all about love, which
    is excellent and - like any real self-help book - challenging and
    difficult and requires taking my time with it.
