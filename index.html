  <h2>2023</h2>

<!--<p>This year has been a year of study: being a student, being a teacher, and experimenting with peer-learning modalities.</p>-->
  
<p>As a visual and performance artist, I continue to work on body data, including systematic self-reflection, such as through consumer self-tracking technologies; but extending to topics related to digital surveillance of human bodies. You can <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOxVOHVzAjU>watch this talk</a> for a detailed overview of the history and future of the work, or see my academic and experimental writings about it <a href=research/index.html>since 2008</a>.


  <p> I currently work as Data & AI Strategist (at Phiture GmbH), and continue to teach workshops and courses related to my prior research on learning technical knowledge. You can stay tuned via <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/kuksenok/>LI</a> for upcoming public event announcements, or get in touch to run a workshop for your organization.<p>

  <p> Until 2025, I am studying as a part-time master's student public administration at the <a href=https://www.hertie-school.org/>Hertie School</a> of public policy and governance. I serve as <a href=https://schoolofcommons.substack.com/>Alumn* Coordinator</a> for the <a href=https://www.schoolofcommons.org/>School of Commons</a>, an initiative at the Zurich University of the Arts dedicated to the study and development of self-organized knowledge. Since July 2021, I have been teaching yoga asana at <a href=https://www.kalaa-yoga-berlin.de/en/schedule/>KALAA Yoga Berlin</a>.</p>

<!--
<p>This year, I have also started to host sessions and workshops related to speculative fiction, with a focus on worldbuilding in either written or visual media; and speculation as a mechanism for engaging with complex contemporary scientific and technological topics.</p>

  <h2>2022</h2>
  
  <!--<p>From March 2022 until March 2023, I worked at <a href=https://phiture.com/>Phiture</A> as a Principal Data Analyst.</p>-->
  <p>For the past several years, I conducted research on building body knowledge through artistic interventions including participatory performance, drawing exercises,
  movement practice, embodied sonic exploration, and discussion. In 2022, this work was supported by the <a href=https://www.schoolofcommons.org>School of Commons</a>; I also taught related courses in 2020-2021 at the School of Machines in Berlin.<br/><br/>
    Here is a flip-through of <a href=https://www.instagram.com/p/Cln7dWtoODT/><em>my art/research journal</em></a> accumulated during this artist residency, including some readings on the subject of understanding unseen body processes and internal communications (specifically, hormones).</li></p>
   
<p><a href=https://criticalcode.recipes/contributions/critical-data-practice-at-home-and-with-friends>CRITICAL DATA PRACTICE AT HOME AND WITH FRIENDS</a> was published in Critical Coding Cookbook. This methodology
  also informed a workshop at the <a href=https://www.weizenbaum-conference.de/>Weizenbaum Conference</a> in Alte MÃ¼nze, Berlin, June 9-10, 2022; facilitated with with <a href=https://minha-lee.github.io/>Minha Lee</a> and Christel de Maeyer.</p>

<p>Created <a href=https://k0.games/howareyou/v1/>#Sergina's Choice-Free Survey Instrument v1.0</A> as <a href=http://www.ellyclarke.com/index.php?/news/serginas-desperately-delicious-dirty-data/>part of an ongoing performance/art collaboration with artist Elly Clarke</a> related to the collection and cleaning of personal data.</p>
</ul>

  <h2>2021</h2>
  <p>From July 2021 until February 2022, I worked at Klang Games as a Senior Data Analyst.</p>
  <p>Throughout 2020 and 2021, I worked on <a href=https://buttondown.email/zero/archive/body-in-time/>various art/research projects</a> on <strong>building body knowledge</strong> through reflection. In <a href=http://databody.art>collaboration with Marisa Satsia</a> and others.</p>
<p><a href="https://buttondown.email/zero/archive/body-in-time/"><img src="0steps/2021-12%20Ora.png" style="width:100%" class="diagram"></a></p>

        <p>Taught <em>Radical Imperfection in Self Tracking</em> as an online course at <A href=http://schoolofma.org>Berlin's School of Machines, Making, and Make-Believe</A>. This 5-week practice-based investigation of difficult self-tracking data was the first of two courses within <a href=http://databody.art>my ongoing research on the data body</a>.

  <h2>2019</h2>

  <p>In collaboration with artist <a href=https://sagejenson.com/>Sage Jenson</a>, an exhibition & performance with an exploratory simulation at the Workshop on Forster, Berlin. You can read more about <a href=speculative-sim>our work here</a>.</p>

  <H2>2018</H2>
  <p>Between 03.2018 and 02.2020, I ran <a href=http://troublebook.club/lostmail>Lost Mail</a>, a monthly visual art and narrative puzzle, crowdfunded through Patreon. In collaboration with <a href=https://www.coraleecreates.com/>Cora Lee</a>, and others.</p>

  <p>For 3.5 years, starting in 2018, I was a software engineer and team lead working on B2B ("business-to-business") chatbots at jobpal Ltd (acquired by SmartRecruiters). I mostly worked with natural-language short-form text, mostly in English and German. I have led and contributed substantially to various technical aspects of GDPR compliance in this product, and am always happy to talk about it!</p>

  <h2>2016</h2>

  <p>Finished my PhD in Seattle and moved to Berlin, and during a number of major life transitions, started one of my favorite personal art projects, <a href="https://ksen0.github.io/do-the-thing/">"Should I Do the Thing?"</a>.</p>

  <h2>2013</h2>

  <p>Published a couple of early research projects at major human-computer interaction (HCI) conferences:
      a <a href=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.648.8036&rep=rep1&type=pdf>qualitative study of technology for foreign language-learning</a>,
      and <a href=https://faculty.washington.edu/aragon/pubs/CSCW2013.pdf>automatically detection emotion in chat messages</a>.</p>

  <h2>2011</h2>

  <p>Published and presented my first academic research work on <a href=https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1978942.1979027>online information seeking for chronic illness management</a>.
  The mixed qualitative/quantitative methods I learned during this project, as well as different approaches
      people have to tracking and understanding their chronic health conditions, continue influence my artistic and research practice, especially when it comes to self-tracking and body data.</p>

  <p><small><em><a href=https://ko-fi.com/s/c1c300f28e>What Now?</a></em> This course is an exercise in worldbuilding and collective storytelling. During each session, we  read and discuss a short work of speculative or science fiction. In addition to a discussion from a literary perspective, we will also develop, over 6 weeks, a multi-faceted imaginative space. Through individual written exercises, participants can inhabit, explore, and challenge the imaginary worlds proposed by the readings.
