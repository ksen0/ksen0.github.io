<p>I arise in the morning torn between a desire to improve the world, and a desire to enjoy the world. This makes it hard to plan the day. (EB White)</p>

<p>You are free when you realize you belong no place - you belong every place - no place at all (Maya Angelou)</p>

<p>It is not necessary for the public to know whether I am joking or whether I am serious, just as it is not necessary for me to know it myself. (Salvador Dalí)</p>

<p>It is more fun to talk with someone who doesn't use long, difficult words but rather short, easy words like "What about lunch?" (A.A. Milne, Winnie-the-Pooh)</p>

<p>Holding on to anger is like grasping a hot coal with the intent of throwing it at someone else; you are the one who gets burned. (The Buddha)</p>

<p>If these years have taught me anything, it is this: you can never run away. Not ever. The only way out is in. (Junot Diaz / The Brief Wondrous Life...)</p>

<p>Love doesn't just sit there, like a stone, it has to be made, like bread; remade all the time, made new. (Ursula K. Le Guin, The Lathe of Heaven)</p>

<p>"Goodbye," said the fox. "And now here is my secret, a very simple secret: It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye." (Antoine de Saint-Exupéry)</p>
