  <h2>2020</h2>

        <p>Taught <em>Radical Imperfection in Self Tracking</em> as an online course at <A href=http://schoolofma.org>Berlin's School of Machines, Making, and Make-Believe</A>. This 5-week practice-based investigation of difficult self-tracking data was the first of two courses within <a href=http://databody.art>my ongoing research on the data body</a>.
-->
  <h2>2019</h2>

  <p>In collaboration with Berlin-based artist <a href=https://sagejenson.com/>Sage Jenson</a>, an exhibition & performance with an exploratory simulation at the Workshop on Forster, Berlin. You can read more about <a href=speculative-sim>our work here</a>, or read one of our articles:</p>

  <H2>2018</H2>
  <p>Between 03.2018 and 02.2020, I ran <a href=http://troublebook.club/lostmail>Lost Mail</a>, a monthly visual art and narrative puzzle, crowdfunded through Patreon. In collaboration with <a href=https://www.coraleecreates.com/>Cora Lee</a>, and others.</p>

  <p>For 3.5 years, starting in 2018, I was a coder working on B2B ("business-to-business") chatbots. As an R&D Engineer at jobpal, Ltd I mostly worked with natural-language short-form text, mostly in English and German. I have led and contributed substantially to various technical aspects of GDPR compliance in this product, and am delighted to talk about it!</p>

  <h2>2016</h2>

  <p>Finished my PhD in Seattle and moved to Berlin, and during a number of major life transitions, started one of my favorite personal art projects, <a href="https://ksen0.github.io/do-the-thing/">"Should I Do the Thing?"</a>.</p>

  <h2>2013</h2>

  <p>Published a couple of early research projects at major human-computer interaction (HCI) conferences:
      a <a href=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.648.8036&rep=rep1&type=pdf>qualitative study of technology for foreign language-learning</a>,
      and <a href=https://faculty.washington.edu/aragon/pubs/CSCW2013.pdf>automatically detection emotion in chat messages</a>.</p>

  <h2>2011</h2>

  <p>Published and presented my first research project, completed mostly during undergraduate study with a lot of wonderful mentorship,
      on <a href=https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1978942.1979027>online information seeking for chronic illness management</a>.
  The mixed qualitative/quantitative methods I learned during this project, as well as different approaches
      people have to tracking and understanding their chronic health conditions, continue influence my artistic and research practice, especially in self-tracking.</p>
