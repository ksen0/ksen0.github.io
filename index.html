<h2>Exciting New Things</h2>

  <h2>2021</h2>
  <p>A work in progress.</p>
  <h2>2020</h2>

        <p>Taught <em>Radical Imperfection in Self Tracking</em> as an online course at <A href=http://schoolofma.org>Berlin's School of Machines, Making, and Make-Believe</A>. It is a 5-week practice-based investigation of difficult self-tracking data, and was the first of two courses within <a href=research>my current research on the data body</a>.
  <h2>2019</h2>

  <p>In collaboration with Berlin-based artist <a href=https://sagejenson.com/>Sage Jenson</a>, an exhibition & performance with an exploratory simulation at the Workshop on Forster, Berlin. You can read more about <a href=speculative-sim>our work here</a>, or read one of our articles:</p>
        <blockquote>Jenson, S., & Kuksenok, K. (2020). How to Observe the Inner Space of a Complex Biological System through Speculative Simulation. Journal of Science and Technology of the Arts, 12(3), 9-24. https://doi.org/10.34632/jsta.2020.9489.</blockquote>
  <H2>2018</H2>

  <p>In February 2018, I started as a Senior R&D Engineer at jobpal Ltd. We build chatbots using machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP).
      I have written about my work in our <a href=https://medium.com/jobpal-dev>tech blog</a>. We were acquired by SmartRecruiters in November 2020,
      and I continue to work on NLP and conversational data analysis as a Lead R&D Engineer.</p>

  <h2>2017</h2>

  <p>Began <a href=http://troublebook.club/lostmail/>Lost Mail</a>, a monthly visual art and narrative puzzle, which ran from 03.2018 until 02.2020, and was successfully crowdfunded through Patreon. In collaboration with <a href=https://www.coraleecreates.com/>Cora Lee</a>, and others.</p>

  <h2>2016</h2>

  <p>Finished my PhD in Seattle and moved to Berlin, and during a number of major life transitions, started one of my favorite personal art projects, <a href="https://ksen0.github.io/do-the-thing/index.html">"Should I Do the Thing?"</a>.</p>

  <h2>2013</h2>

  <p>Published a couple of early research projects at major human-computer interaction (HCI) conferences:
      a <a href=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.648.8036&rep=rep1&type=pdf>qualitative study of technology for foreign language-learning</a>,
      and <a href=https://faculty.washington.edu/aragon/pubs/CSCW2013.pdf>automatically detection emotion in chat messages</a>.</p>

  <h2>2011</h2>

  <p>Published and presented my first research project, completed mostly during undergraduate study with a lot of wonderful mentorship,
      on <a href=https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1978942.1979027>online information seeking for chronic illness management</a>.
  The mixed qualitative/quantitative methods I learned during this project, as well as different approaches
      people have to tracking and understanding their chronic health conditions, continue influence my artistic and research practice, especially in self-tracking.</p>
