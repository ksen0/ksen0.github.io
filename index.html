<p>Hello! I am Kit Kuksenok (<small>KSEN ZERO</small> / k0)</p>

<p>I am a  <a href="art/">visual artist</a>, <a href="research/">researcher</a>, and <a href="http://ksen0.github.io/code-data-work/">code worker</a> based in Berlin.</p>

<p><a href="kit/">More about me...</a><br>Looking for my <a href=cv.pdf class='scholar'>CV</a>?</p>


<h2>2020</h2>

    <p>Started teaching <em>Radical Imperfection in Self Tracking</em> as an <A href=http://schoolofma.org/radical-imperfection>online course at Berlin's School of Machines, Making, and Make-Believe</A>. It is a 5-week practice-based investigation of difficult self-tracking data.</p>

<h2>2019</h2>

<p>In collaboration with Berlin-based artist <a href=https://sagejenson.com/>Sage Jenson</a>, an <a href=https://www.sagejenson.com/dismantling-2019>exhibition & performance with an exploratory simulation</a> at the Workshop on Forster, Berlin. Additionally, we wrote <a href=https://2020.xcoax.org/pdf/xCoAx2020-Jenson.pdf>an article about it</a>, and you can watch <A href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qMjzLWUz2Xw">our talk (with visuals from the performance)</A>.</p>

<H2>2018</H2>

<p>In February 2018, I started as a Senior R&D Engineer at jobpal Ltd. We build chatbots using machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP). 
    I have written about my work in our <a href=https://medium.com/jobpal-dev>tech blog</a>. We were acquired by SmartRecruiters in November 2020,
    and I continued to work on NLP and conversational data analysis as a Lead R&D Engineer.</p>

<h2>2017</h2>

<p>Began <a href=http://troublebook.club/lostmail/>Lost Mail</a>, a monthly visual art and narrative puzzle, which ran from 03.2018 until 02.2020, and was successfully crowdfunded through Patreon. In collaboration with <a href=https://www.coraleecreates.com/>Cora Lee</a>, and others.</p>

<h2>2016</h2>

<p>Finished my PhD in Seattle and moved to Berlin, and during a number of major life transitions, started one of my favorite personal art projects, <a href="https://ksen0.github.io/do-the-thing/index.html">"Should I Do the Thing?"</a>.</p>

<h2>2013</h2>

<p>Published a couple of early research projects at major human-computer interaction (HCI) conferences:
    a <a href=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.648.8036&rep=rep1&type=pdf>qualitative study of technology for foreign language-learning</a>, 
    and <a href=https://faculty.washington.edu/aragon/pubs/CSCW2013.pdf>automatically detection emotion in chat messages</a>.</p>

<h2>2011</h2>

<p>Published and presented my first research project, completed mostly during undergraduate study with a lot of wonderful mentorship,
    on <a href=https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1978942.1979027>online information seeking for chronic illness management</a>.
The mixed qualitative/quantitative methods I learned during this project, as well as different approaches
    people have to tracking and understanding their chronic health conditions, continue influence my artistic and research practice, especially in self-tracking.</p>
