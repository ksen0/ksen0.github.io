  <h2>2023</h2>

  <p>Currently, I am studying in the Executive Master of Public Administration program at the <a href=https://www.hertie-school.org/>Hertie School</a>. I work as Data & AI Strategist at <a href=https://phiture.com/>Phiture GmbH</a>, the leading mobile growth consultancy and agency. I serve as the <a href=https://schoolofcommons.substack.com/>Alumn* Coordinator</a> for the <a href=https://www.schoolofcommons.org/>School of Commons</a>, an initiative at the Zurich University of the Arts dedicated to the study and development of self-organized knowledge.</p>
  
  <p>I continue to teach workshops and courses related to <strong>learning</strong> and <strong>embodiment</strong>; you can get in touch / stay tuned via <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/kuksenok/>LI</a> or <a href=https://www.instagram.com/xn_ze_ro/>IG</a> for upcoming event announcements, or join any of the public events below.<p>

<p>As a visual and performance artist, I continue to work on body data, including systematic self-reflection, such as through consumer self-tracking technologies; but extending to topics related to digital surveillance of human bodies. I use participatory performance, drawing, and movement to study encounters with body data. This work has been, in some form, <a href=research/index.html>ongoing since 2008</a>.</p>

<p>Since July 2021, I have been teaching yoga asana at <a href=https://www.kalaa-yoga-berlin.de/en/schedule/>KALAA Yoga Berlin</a>.</p>

  <h2>2022</h2>
  
  <!--<p>From March 2022 until March 2023, I worked at <a href=https://phiture.com/>Phiture</A> as a Principal Data Analyst.</p>-->
  <p>For the past several years, I conducted research on building body knowledge through artistic interventions including participatory performance, drawing exercises,
  movement practice, embodied sonic exploration, and discussion. In 2022, this work was supported by the <a href=https://www.schoolofcommons.org>School of Commons</a>; I also taught related courses in 2020-2021 at the School of Machines in Berlin.<br/><br/>
    Here is a flip-through of <a href=https://www.instagram.com/p/Cln7dWtoODT/><em>my art/research journal</em></a> accumulated during this artist residency, including some readings on the subject of understanding unseen body processes and internal communications (specifically, hormones).</li></p>
   
<p><a href=https://criticalcode.recipes/contributions/critical-data-practice-at-home-and-with-friends>CRITICAL DATA PRACTICE AT HOME AND WITH FRIENDS</a> was published in Critical Coding Cookbook. This methodology
  also informed a workshop at the <a href=https://www.weizenbaum-conference.de/>Weizenbaum Conference</a> in Alte MÃ¼nze, Berlin, June 9-10, 2022; facilitated with with <a href=https://minha-lee.github.io/>Minha Lee</a> and Christel de Maeyer.</p>

<p>Created <a href=https://k0.games/howareyou/v1/>#Sergina's Choice-Free Survey Instrument v1.0</A> as <a href=http://www.ellyclarke.com/index.php?/news/serginas-desperately-delicious-dirty-data/>part of an ongoing performance/art collaboration with artist Elly Clarke</a> related to the collection and cleaning of personal data.</p>

  <h2>2021</h2>
  <p>From July 2021 until February 2022, I worked at Klang Games as a Senior Data Analyst.</p>
  <p>Throughout 2020 and 2021, I worked on <a href=https://buttondown.email/zero/archive/body-in-time/>various art/research projects</a> on <strong>building body knowledge</strong> through reflection. In <a href=http://databody.art>collaboration with Marisa Satsia</a> and others.</p>
<p><a href="https://buttondown.email/zero/archive/body-in-time/"><img src="0steps/2021-12%20Ora.png" style="width:100%" class="diagram"></a></p>

        <p>Taught <em>Radical Imperfection in Self Tracking</em> as an online course at <A href=http://schoolofma.org>Berlin's School of Machines, Making, and Make-Believe</A>. This 5-week practice-based investigation of difficult self-tracking data was the first of two courses within <a href=http://databody.art>my ongoing research on the data body</a>.

  <h2>2019</h2>

  <p>In collaboration with artist <a href=https://sagejenson.com/>Sage Jenson</a>, an exhibition & performance with an exploratory simulation at the Workshop on Forster, Berlin. You can read more about <a href=speculative-sim>our work here</a>.</p>

  <H2>2018</H2>
  <p>Between 03.2018 and 02.2020, I ran <a href=http://troublebook.club/lostmail>Lost Mail</a>, a monthly visual art and narrative puzzle, crowdfunded through Patreon. In collaboration with <a href=https://www.coraleecreates.com/>Cora Lee</a>, and others.</p>

  <p>For 3.5 years, starting in 2018, I was a coder working on B2B ("business-to-business") chatbots. As an R&D Engineer at jobpal, Ltd I mostly worked with natural-language short-form text, mostly in English and German. I have led and contributed substantially to various technical aspects of GDPR compliance in this product, and am delighted to talk about it!</p>

  <h2>2016</h2>

  <p>Finished my PhD in Seattle and moved to Berlin, and during a number of major life transitions, started one of my favorite personal art projects, <a href="https://ksen0.github.io/do-the-thing/">"Should I Do the Thing?"</a>.</p>

  <h2>2013</h2>

  <p>Published a couple of early research projects at major human-computer interaction (HCI) conferences:
      a <a href=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.648.8036&rep=rep1&type=pdf>qualitative study of technology for foreign language-learning</a>,
      and <a href=https://faculty.washington.edu/aragon/pubs/CSCW2013.pdf>automatically detection emotion in chat messages</a>.</p>

  <h2>2011</h2>

  <p>Published and presented my first research project, completed mostly during undergraduate study with a lot of wonderful mentorship,
      on <a href=https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1978942.1979027>online information seeking for chronic illness management</a>.
  The mixed qualitative/quantitative methods I learned during this project, as well as different approaches
      people have to tracking and understanding their chronic health conditions, continue influence my artistic and research practice, especially in self-tracking.</p>

  <p><small><em><a href=https://ko-fi.com/s/c1c300f28e>What Now?</a></em> This course is an exercise in worldbuilding and collective storytelling. During each session, we  read and discuss a short work of speculative or science fiction. In addition to a discussion from a literary perspective, we will also develop, over 6 weeks, a multi-faceted imaginative space. Through individual written exercises, participants can inhabit, explore, and challenge the imaginary worlds proposed by the readings.

<p><small><em>Body Songs (2022)</em> was a participatory performance, co-presented with as part of <em>of the echoing hills</em> with Lili Huston-Herterich and Elisa Lemma
  at the School of Commons end of year show at the ZHdK Orgelsaal. A participatory performance using drawing, sound, and memory as vehicles for reflecting on bodily experience, specifically cyclic experiences. The audience was invited to participate in a co-constructed rhythmic vocal composition exploring the physical, mental, or energetic shifts that occur within their/our bodies during a day, a month, or a year.
