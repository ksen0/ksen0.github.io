        <li>Qualitative study combining a year-long ethnographic and interview study of several ocean science research groups; and a series of interviews and observations with data science educaitonal initiatives (e.g., Software Carpentry Workshops)</li>

        <li>What are some effective patterns for cultivating both technological efficacy (the sense of technical empowerment, rather than anxiety and helplessness) and technological effectiveness (the capacity to follow through) in a collaborative context?</li></ul></li>
    <li class="bracket"><strong>Social media use in the most recent Maidan movement in Ukraine.</strong> Read <a href=https://medium.com/what-about/hope-lies-the-internet-9a983cd68f66>the summary article (Central European University, 2014)</a> for more context and many quotes from interviews with Maidan activists; check out the <a href=http://www.amazon.com/Digital-Eastern-Europe-William-Schreiber-ebook/dp/B00X80T1QI>chapter in <em>Digital Eastern Europe (2015)</em></a>; orsee the conclusions excerpted below:<ul>
        <li>Having spent six weeks in Ukraine, I found that the speed with which social media spread messages enabled the dissemination of both first-hand information and misinformation. Claims such as Gladwell’s indict social media as being too superficial and ephemeral to help people forge strong social ties during nascent political movements. However, the interviews I collected contained many stories of connections being forged across geographic and political boundaries. I do agree that there is no such thing as a “Twitter revolution,” for two reasons.</li>
            <li>Firstly, attributing any one social networking platform with success ignores the importance of the diversity of the sociotechnical ecosystem. Different people (casual users, activists, journalists) exist in different social circles and on different online platforms, and the availability of multiple technologies allows some degree of choice based on the needs on the ground. The needs are complex: to spread information, to cull misinformation, to organize rides to a demonstration.</li>
        <li>Secondly, and much more importantly, a political movement is a physical phenomenon, not just an online one. Real-world action and discussion is the critical outcome, not the virtual interaction that helps organize or inform. Measuring online activity, the numbers of Likes and Shares, is a truly tiny fragment of the picture. A video shared on social networks, created by journalists, re-appropriated by individuals engaged in truth-finding campaigns has an impact not because of how much it is Liked and Shared, but because of it gained critical mass and became a catalyst for discussion beyond the technology.</li></ul></li>
    <li class="bracket"><a href=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2466129><strong>Challenges and Opportunities for Technology in Foreign Language Classrooms</strong> (2012)</a> - here's an excerpt of this academic report on an ethnography of introductory Russian classrooms at the University of Washington:<ul>
        <li>Feedback as a negotiated process, not event: a key benefit of technology for education is to help more effectively redistribute  the  teacher’s  time,  such  as  by  providing automatic   feedback   where   possible. Technology that can accomplish this is very different in the social, rather than individual, context. Negotiated feedback from peers, using repetition and correction as  a signal, was an important aspect of the classroom, and technology that provides feedback could benefit greatly from  similar  minimally  intrusive,  example-based approaches. </li><li>Authenticity  vs.  metalinguistic  discussion: To  support multilingual  interaction,  technology  must  balance 
authenticity and use of the foreign language against the need  to  use  the  first  language  for  metalinguistic 
discussion.  In  the  cases  where  technologies  such  as speech  recognition  are  used,  it  is  crucial  to  keep  in 
mind that there are at least two languages used in the introductory classroom. </li><li>Joy,  creativity,  and  props: 
To  support  creative  and entertaining role-play, technological artifacts should be shared  within  small  groups,  and  enable  open-ended activities. This can either mean rapid image look-up or  sketching,  or  dynamic,  interactive  dialogues  that support engagement over more scripted exercises. </li></ul></li>

        <ul>
        <li>Including <a href=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2470664>Accessible Content Creation by End Users (2013)</a> on how people self-moderate accessibility on a Lyme forum vs. wikipedia</li>
            <li><a href=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1979027>Competing online viewpoints and models of chronic illness (2011)</a>: reports on dozens of interviews and ~150 survey responses, and offers design implications on the basis of the findings. For example, we suggest that patient-oriented online information resources "expose  multiple  explanatory  models,  where  they  exist. In the many situations where knowledge of chronic disease is uncertain, people  seek  explanations  from  multiple  types  of online  resources.  <strong>We  argue  that,  rather  than  causing  harm, seeing the diversity of health resources online may lead to a more  nuanced  understanding  of  and  involvement  in  the debates  around  a  health  condition.</strong>  Because  the  scientific basis of disease, medical knowledge, treatments, and social and  legal  conditions  for  those  with  chronic  conditions  is continually  changing,  we  argue  that  patients  are  better prepared to adjust their model of illness if they are exposed to diverse and proliferating viewpoints."</li></ul></li>

<h2>How I Do User Research</h2>
    Click through for the <a href=https://medium.com/what-about/how-i-do-user-research-fabc89acc7c9><strong>full tutorial on how I do user research</strong></a>, or check out the summary below:
    <ul>
<li>How to Conduct Exploratory Interviews: it’s usually worth doing, and the way to interview well is to be flexible and an active listener</li>
    <li>How to Interview to Evaluate a Prototype: be specific, and ask user study participants to compare and contrast, not to criticize</li>
<li>How to Compose a Survey: keep it short and simple, don’t force opinions, have at least one open-ended prompt for “debugging”</li>
<li>How to Discover Themes: qualitative analysis is a systematic way of using the human capacity to categorize things</li>
<li>How to Use Theory and Related Research: short primer on how to read HCI papers for fun and profit</li>
<li class="bracket">Fundamental Principles of User Research (or, what I think the fundamental principles ought to be):
    <ol>
        <li>Principle 1: The creators of technology are in a difficult spot: on the one hand, we are users of technology; on the other, we are often not typical target users. As such, we can be limited by unspoken assumptions. <strong>Open-ended study of how people use technology is important in uprooting our assumptions about what technology does, is, or could be.</strong></li>
        <li>Principle 2: Technology and its use is pervasive. Besides hardware questions (eg, device ecosystems or networking infrastructure) and software questions (eg, compatibility and social buy-in), there are questions of social norms (eg, texting on a date) and policy (eg, Google Glass in a movie theater) and access (eg, blind users and voice-over, or users with cerebral palsy and alternative pointing devices). <strong>The researcher must get creative and and use a variety of methodological tools</strong> to understand anything at all about how people use technology.</li>
        <li>Principle 3: The subject of user research is the technology or its use. People are not your subjects; they are your informants or participants. Remember that they (most often) get involved (1) because you are nice, and/or (2) because what you’re working on is cool. <strong>The researcher must actively pursue constructive criticism through deliberate method selection.</strong></li></ol></li>

    <li>I am currently building an interactive wearable creepy-looking mask thing (very early progress shown to the right), painting a piano for public use in a Seattle park, polishing up my Japanese and learning some German, and working on a short horror story collection.</li>
    <li>I have previously taugh ESL at LiteracySource in Seattle, lead twice-weekly meditaiton sessions at the University of Washington through the UWMP, failed to learn any Icelandic whatsoever, and contributed a comic to an anthology of dream-inspired comics.</li>
    <li>My preferred means of locomotion is the bicycle; my preferred means of travel through time/space is the seat of my pants. The compliment which I am most proud to have received (and which I most vigilantly work to be worthy of) is: "wow, you are an institution onto yourself."</li>
    <li class="bracket">My favorite Sunday read is the <a href=http://brainpickings.org>brainpickings</a> newsletter. Of the following reflections, not a single one is another post about lifehacking.
<ul><li><a href=https://medium.com/compassionate-productivity/the-gentle-calibration-of-the-qualified-self-59aa3c7d1900>The Gentle Calibration of the Qualified Self (2014)</a> When I was first learning about the methods of empirical cultural anthropology that I encountered a curious idea: “in the natural sciences, there are instruments, which must work well, and must be calibrated. In the social sciences, we are the instruments.” I no longer remember the source of this wisdom, but I have really taken to the notion of “calibrating” myself, the “instrument,” not just when I’m doing ethnographic research, but when I am programming, or designing, or drawing, or writing, or teaching. It is in this spirit that the below productivity strategies, and reflections on productivity, are presented.</li>
