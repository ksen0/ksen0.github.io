	<h1>Katerena Kuksenok<br><small><a href=cv.php>Resume / Short CV</a> | updated October, 2014</small></h1>
	<div class="body">
		<p>Hello! I am Katie, avid reader, traveler, artist and writer. I remain cautiously hopeful about the potential of technology to support democracy and lower barrier to education.</p>
		<p><strong>Group Dynamics and Technology</strong> I do research at the intersection of <em>how people communicate</em> and <em>how people use technology</em>. I have a Master of Science in Computer Science (University of Washington), a Bachelor of Arts in Applied Math (Oberlin College), and am currently working on a PhD in computer Science (UW). My thesis is on <strong>how oceanography groups overcome challenges to integrating data science practice into their scientific process</strong>; this involves interviews with scientists, in-depth ethnographic participant-observations, and then developing software design and organization implications to benefit <a href=http://www.moore.org/programs/science/data-driven-discovery/data-science-environments>the Moore/Sloan data science environments initiative</a>. This research is co-advised by James Fogarty (UW CSE) and Cecilia Aragon (UW HCDE).</p>
		<p><strong>Language and Technology.</strong> I am fluent in English, Ukrainian, and Russian. I dabbled in machine translation earlier in my research career, and I often combine qualitative research methods with automated natural language processing and machine learning techniques. So, I am always delighted to discuss literature, foreign language education, computational linguistics, applied linguistics, or pretty much anything that has to do with the endlessly fascinating subject of humans using words to communicate ideas to each other. Over the last several months, I went to Ukraine to study <u>the role of social media in the euromaidan movement</u>, a project which I intend to continue after the completion of my ongoing thesis work. <a href=maidan?lang=eng>If you have used social media at all in any way regarding the ongoing political situation in Ukraine, please consider participating in this study as an interviewee.</a></p>
