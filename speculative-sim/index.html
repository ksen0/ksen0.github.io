<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>We present an approach for composition and performance with
speculative complex biological systems. The goal of this approach is
to incorporate not only the content of scientific work but the activities
of scientific practice, specifically exploratory modelling with a computer
simulation. We present the method, a conceptual framework and a list of
exercises, and demonstrate its application in two generative art works.
The framework distinguishes a system, its representation, and the human
observers; this helps to clarify influences, material artifacts, and sources
of tension. In <em>Dismantling</em>, a live performance using a simulation based on
a model of the acellular slime mold Physarum polycephalum, we explore a
shifting locus of agency during the performance between the observer and
the representation. In <em>Feed</em>, a visual and sound installation representing addiction as a
multi-scale process, we explore the generative tension of representation reuse
to engage with different systems. The model specifications of biological
phenomena are used as bases for interactive complex network simulations.</p>

<p><em>"...In this way, digital ink materiality has no counterpart
in the realm of physical ink materiality. Digital ink allows the scribe to intentionally
shift agency between themselves and the simulation; and to engage with the simulated
system agency at a level of complexity and scale inaccessible in a physical handwriting
medium."</em></p>
