<h1>Hello!</h1>

<p>My name is Kit Kuksenok (they/them) and I teach vinyasa yoga classes, which  bind  movement with breath as we flow through a sequence of asana, or poses. You don't need any specific prior experience or ability, just curiousity.</p>


<p>My yoga journey timeline:

<ul>
  <li><em>(ongoing, until Dec. 2021)</em> 300H Advanced Vinyasa and Restorative Practices YTT @ KALAA Yoga Berlin</li>
  <li>2019-2020: 200H Vinyasa Yoga Teacher Training<br>@ KALAA Yoga Berlin</li>
  <li>2011/2012: I first encountered yoga in Seattle, and it became an essential part of working with chronic pain associated with wrist injury. This experience continues to inform my personal yoga practice, and my teaching style; even in more challenging sequences, I try to reduce excess stress on shoulders/wrists, while building strength, balance, and mobility in these areas <a href=#wrists>(more info below...)</a></li>
</ul>

</p>


<!-- <p>* For me, <strong>discipline</strong> is both doing all the preparation - coming to the mat, stilling your mind, warming up the body - for something that challenges you (let's say, headstand, for example). And discipline is also recognizing when you are starting to try that challenging thing that it's not accessible yet, and then backing off. Discipline is both showing up and not over-stepping.</p>

    The problem I am solving is getting started in discipline and awareness. By practicing together, we support one another.

<p>Looking forward to see you in the next class!</p>


<h1>Cost</h1>

<p>These are semi-private classes of 2-5 people. To the extent that you are financially able, please budget <strong>6-15EUR</strong> per class. You can decide on how much makes sense, and <strong>donate that amount to a charitable organisation of your choice</strong>. Here are some ideas:
<ul>
    <li>Berlin: <a href=https://www.gofundme.com/f/queer-black-therapy-fund>Queer Black Therapy Fund</a>, a direct-support project supported by Gladt eV and Stillpoint Spaces Berlin</li>
    <li>Berlin: <a href=https://www.gofundme.com/f/casa-kua>Casa Ku√†</a>, the only space in Germany self-organized by and focused on specifically trans* inter* queer, Black, Indigenous and People of Colour. We need a space where we feel comfortable and seen. The aim of Casa Ku√† is to bring alternative, traditional, and conventional medicine together.</li>
    <li>USA: <a href=https://www.californiareentryinstitute.org>CA Re-Entry Institute</a> Preparing men for and supporting them through the transition from incarceration to freedom, assisting them in being contributing members of society.  Proving that with preparation and support, the cycle of incarceration can be broken.</li>
    <li>Poland: <a href=https://wspieraj.kph.org.pl>Campaign against homophobia</a></li>
    <li><em>Your local org that benefits from even small financial donations:)</em></li></ul>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>Teaching online allows me to keep operating costs low. <strong>If you join often</strong>, please consider <a href=https://ko-fi.com/kitkuksenok>supporting my ongoing projects and continuing yoga training</a>.</p>

<h1>Wrist and Shoulder Care</h1>

<p>All classes marked withüëêaim to minimize excess stress on shoulders/wrists, the sequences will focus on developing balance, control, and strength in the shoulders through:</p>

<p>(1) warming up the shoulders, neck, and wrists<br>
(2) not placing entire body weight onto wrists<br>
(3) using forearm variations for arm balances</p>

<h1>Off the Mat</h1>

<p>You can connect with me on Instagram! On my account <a href=https://www.instagram.com/curious.practice/>@curious.practice</a>, I post about sustainable self-reflection & embodied practice off the mat. Self-study is a big part of the path of yoga, and something I've studied and lived for a long time, so I'm happy to be sharing what I've learned, as well as what I'm still exploring.</p>
