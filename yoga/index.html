<h1>Hello!</h1>

<p>My name is Kit Kuksenok, and I am a transgender non-binary person (my pronouns are they/them). I teach Vinyasa Yoga, which focuses on binding  movement with breath as we flow through a sequence of Asana, or poses. You don't need any specific prior experience or ability, just curiousity. <!--Both in holding longer stretches, and in those where we practive dynamic, flowing movement, I try to encourage each student to find the <strong>first sensation</strong> and to take time to explore it.--> The body is not a tool for finding a particular posture; the movement is a tool to explore the body.</p>

<p>For me, the <strong>cultivation of discipline and awareness</strong> is both the purpose and the method of Yoga Asana practice. <!--As a teacher, I aim to create an environment of softness, exploration, and curiousity.--> I initially discovered Yoga Asana in 2011, and completed my 200H Teacher Training in 2019-2020 in KALAA Yoga Berlin. <!--TK Yoga for all--></p>

<!--<p>I strongly believe that <strong>violence is not necessary for transformation</strong>.  Through Yoga, I have found joy and acceptance in my body: as a transgender non-binary person, I've noticed that much of the "gender transition" rhetoric focuses on the body as "wrong" and as the root of dysphoria. Yoga has been a way not only to recover from repetitive-stress injury in my wrists and shoulders, but also to find peace and softness with my body. Both my gender transition and my personal yoga practice has taught me that <em>being</em> and <em>becoming</em> are not mutually exclusive. When I am fully present in my body (<em>being</em>), using its skills and following its curiousities, I am also <em>becoming</em>. In teaching sequences, I aim to call attention to opportunities for exploration, as well as support finding - and <em>being</em> in - the Asana.</p>-->

<!-- <p>* For me, <strong>discipline</strong> is both doing all the preparation - coming to the mat, stilling your mind, warming up the body - for something that challenges you (let's say, headstand, for example). And discipline is also recognizing when you are starting to try that challenging thing that it's not accessible yet, and then backing off. Discipline is both showing up and not over-stepping.</p>

    The problem I am solving is getting started in discipline and awareness. By practicing together, we support one another.


<h1>Cost / Donation Suggestion</h1>

-->

<p>The classes are free and small. I am at the beginning of my teaching journey, and I am grateful for the opportunity to practice teching. Teaching online from my home allows me to keep operating costs very low (around 30eur/mo for online tools), and <a href=https://ko-fi.com/kitkuksenok>your support is appreciated but not required</a>. If you are able to pay <strong>3-10EUR</strong> for a yoga class, consider <strong>donating that amount to a charitable organisation of your choice</strong>. </p>


<h1>Schedule</h1>

<p>All classes are 75 minutes. Each class has its own more specific focus. Here is what you can expect overall:</p>

<p>Tuesday 19:00CET üëê balance focus<br>
Thursday 8:00CET inversions focus<br>
Saturday 18:00CET üëêlong poses</p>


<p>üëê aiming to minimize excess stress on shoulders/wrists, the sequences will focus on developing balance, control, and strength in the shoulders through:</p>

<p>warming up the shoulders, neck, and wrists<br>
not placing entire body weight onto wrists<br>
using forearm variations for arm balances</p>
