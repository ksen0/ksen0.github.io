Hi there, nice of you to check the source code!

I used to do some web development work on a freelance or part-time basis around 2005-2010, and it's been amazing to see the developments in front-end work. I did briefly maintain a react.js website (redux) for a few months in 2018 while the team I was on looked for a front-end developer, but ultimately I only use vanilla JavaScript (and sometimes p5.js) in occasional personal projects.

For example, here is some interactive art I made for an exhibition with Elly Clarke: https://k0.games/howareyou/v1/ - try typing for a while:)

I am also very interested in regulation around data and issues of data privacy online, so despite being very fond of numbers, I use absolutely no trackers of any kind in any of my projects.

  <h1>Kit Kuksenok, PhD</h1>

  <p>Hello! I'm Kit, and I am a Berlin-based technical trainer, artist, and data analyst. I hold a MSci (2014) and a PhD (2016) in Computer Science and Engineering from the University of Washington (Seattle); and I am currently working on my masters in public administraction at the Hertie School of public policy and governance in Berlin.</p>

  <h1>Technical Trainer</h1>

  <p>As a technical trainer for organizations across sizes and sectors, I help teams <strong>adapt emerging technologies to the  needs of their work</strong>.</p>

  <p>The topic of organizational change, and how a group can adapt new technologies to their work, was <a href=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10606-017-9285-x>the subject of my PhD</a>. Over the last decade, I have greatly expanded my knowledge of organizational change and technological adaptation through experience as a software engineer and data analyst; and through coursework and training within my current master's program. Since 2010, I have worked with teams at: Amazon.com, Google, Facebook, AT&T Labs, jobpal Ltd (acquired by SmartRecruiters), Phiture GmbH (Berlin), Curve Labs (Berlin), varia (Rotterdam), Klang Games (Berlin), School of Commons (ZÃ¼rich) - and others, including through consulting work.</p>
</p>

  <p>I work with teams to find the most effective tools and practices to meet a variety of needs, including:</p>


  <div class="blurb a" style="width:250px">
    <h3>Sharing Technical Knowledge</h3>
    <p>How can an organization or team (big or small) build a culture of effective knowledge sharing and documentation? Includes a workshop to help understand the current barriers and challenges.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="blurb c" style="width:300px">
    <h3>Meeting Change with Confidence</h3>
    <p>What is the most ligthweight and practical way to ensure the reliability of a product that is in active development, or that relies on third-party tools that can significantly change over time? I dig into validation, testing, and monitoring strategies and practical tools at the level of technical detail that best supports the audience. Tailored to a particular team, organization, or product.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="blurb a" style="width:300px">
    <h3>Actionable User Research</h3>
    <p>Based on extensive industry and academic experience doing user research since 2008, both through qualitative (interviews and ethnography) and quantitative (surveys and analysis of user-generated data), I have helped consumer technology teams make the most of user research and uncover actionable insights..</p>
  </div>


  <div class="blurb b" style="width:500px">
    <h3>Multilangual Support with AI</h3>
    <p>Today's tools for natural-language understanding and generation are very good and getting better, but there are persistent challenges in supporting multiple languages. This is especially important to consider when the languages supported are not languages spoken within the organization or team, so there is greater reliance on an (imperfect, though good) AI tool. I have worked on machine translation within my MSci (2014) and since then have extensively worked with automated analysis of text, both building models, and using third-party solutions. I have also built and used chatbots  since 2018, most recently working with using generative AI tools for app marketing.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="blurb b" style="width:250px">
    <h3>Diversity in Hiring</h3>
    <p>This workshop focuses specifically at the tools and processes used throughout hiring, and how they can more effectively support inclusive and equitable practices during the entire hiring process, from sourcing, to interviewing, to onboadring. Drawing on my knowledge of talent acquisition technologies, metrics, and practices; and training on inclusion in digital organizations. </p>

I use participatory performance, drawing, and movement to study how people encounter body data. This work, ongoing since 2008,  has included systematic self-reflection, such as through consumer self-tracking technologies; recently extending to digital surveillance of human bodies.</p>
