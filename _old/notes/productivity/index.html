<h2>Meta-Productivity</h2>

<p>I always tried to be honest with myself that "productivity hacking" and all these<br>advanced data-driven acrobatics<br>are nearly as much about productivity as they are about semi-acceptable procrastination.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, In the last year+, I have writen minimally about productivity, but I had a lot of small tools <a href=#lifehacks>(lifehacks, I guess</a> that helped remain sane and grounded and fresh.</p>

<h2>Meaning-o-Meter</h2>

<p>Before we talk about productivity, we have to talk about its object: what actually are the things getting done? Here's one way to think about <strong>whether you should do the thing</strong>:</p>

<div id="meaning">
  <p id="meaning_q1">Is the thing worth doing by <em>anyone</em>? <span class="option" data-next="meaning_q2">Yes</span> <span class="option" data-next="">No</span> <span class="option"  data-next="">...Kinda?</span> </p>
  <p id="meaning_q2">Is the thing worth doing by <em>you in particular</em>? <span class="option">Yes, I am well-positioned to make impact in this area.</span> <span class="option" data-next="meaning_q3">No, someone else would do it a lot better.</span></p>
  <p id="meaning_q3">Those are harsh words! Are you <em>sure</em> that's not just impostor syndrome talking?
  <!-- TK dont let your dreams be dreams thingy -->
  </p>
</div>

<h2>Baby Steps</h2>

<p>Nothing happens overnight. 15 minutes every day for a year is only about 2 weeks' worth of hard work<br><em>365 * 15 / 60 = 91.25</em><br>but in 2 weeks, if you spend 5 days facing some<br>bottomless existential pit<br>that's a tragedy, and the pit deepens and darkens.</p>

<p>This is unnecessary. Even if you spend a third of the year battling demons, if you spread your work out, 

<h2>Lifehacking / Anti-lifehacking </h2>

<p><small>2013, Seattle. Included in the <a href=https://medium.com/ok-work/the-gentle-calibration-of-the-qualified-self-59aa3c7d1900>Qualified Self essay</a></small></p>
<p>
Lifehacking, as a word, implies a kind of internalized brutality; take an axe to your wrongness, hack it away. Hack together a tangle of stick-and-carrot punishment-reward strategies in the resulting wound. Do this for your work, your friendships, your finances, your closet, your soul, until you’ve hacked off all the wrong bits and replaced them all with fragile tips-and-tricks and a fountain of guilt gushing out of all the inevitable seams. The guilt is acid, and it erodes your sense of competence and wrecks the teetering tower of apps, and now you have a million reminders for a million tasks in a million todo apps, all of which you don’t use because the prospect of facing everything that you haven’t done is paralyzing. So you spend another hour hating yourself for staring at the soul-sucking blue of facebook.</p>
<p>I'm trying to do that less, but sometimes I don’t succeed.</p>
<p>I'm trying to be okay with that, too.</p>
