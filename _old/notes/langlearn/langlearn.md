Learning foreign languages was such a pervasive and major aspect of my existence, that, of course, it was the first subject I tackled when I began to think up research subjects. In 2013, I presented on some colaborative research on the potential of technology in the language learning classroom. The paper mainly contributed the analysis of observations and interviews conducted as part of a graduate course on qualitative methods in HCI. Then we took these ideas and squeezed out of them implications for design. Despite acknowledging the real and valid reasons for widespread reluctance to include technolgy in foreign-language learnign classrooms, we remained hopeful. Our ideas boiled down to two types: first, classroom technology not specific to language learning, and second, authentic materials engagements.

"Authentic materials" refers to anythign created by native speakers of a language, for native speakers of a language. When my parents and I, still in Kiev circa Y2K, religiously re-watched _The Fifth Element_ and _Groundhog Day_, consulting their scripts, we were learning. Something interesting happens when you learn about a culture through its fiction, though. We thought that "super green" was an english-langugae interjection, rather than the fictional flamboyance of a spectacular fictional flamboyant. We also did not even consider the possibility that Groundhog Day may be a real, actual Pennsylvanian phenomenon. The world of Prima Donna Bill Murray was so culturally bizarre that the timeloop was the most relatable aspect of it. When we actually came to Pittsburgh, it took us at least 1 or 2 additional viewings of Groundhog Day to make the connection that we _live_ in the place in the opening shot, and that the Punxatawny festivities exist. We were also surprised to learn that many Red-Blooded Americans do not like The Fifth Element, and that it can be almost too European.

Fast forward from Y2K to grad school. I latched onto this idea of authentic materials, and on how technology can make them more accessible, in a cultural sense. For a few years, I worked on an application in between human-computer interaction and machine translaiton filds [TK Link] that would help people edit articles translated into the language they were learning. Because even if you, as a reader or learner, aren't sure what something is supposed to say, automated translation is so fantastically _inhuman_ that a lot of basic errors can be fixed by common sense. Now, Google Translate allows some degree of editing for snippets, and Duolingo community has some kind of translation fixing points system. When I was working on it, these ideas were fresh, Duolingo hadn't launched yes and GT had a static single output, and I thought this concept would revolutionize how computers are used in language learning.

But that didn't really happen. Not only did the application I made disappoint me, all the other similar things that arose around that time disappointed too. Althrough I had changed my research topic after a wave of rejections, the concept stuck around in my head, and so did the question: what are the game-changers that technology can offer to the stange and wonderful experience of discovering the knowledge of a different language and, consequently, culture?

In the rest of this essay, I will take those three posh words, "athentic materials engagement," and dwell on each of them, in light of what I've learned since that first research fumble, through a variety of other experiences.

"Authentic." This word, in this phrase, refers to the quality of something being _by and for_ native speakers. Let's stick to that relatively narrow definition and not get any more philosophical than absolutely necessary.

TK End with Literacy Source

"Materials." Start up from literacy source, and YouTube. And latent delivery networks or whatever. I still think this is super cool in a way that a fragile, feature-full chrome plugin or app or whatever cannot be.

"Engagement." From August 2016 up through May 2017, I had something like 2 - 2.5 hours of daily commute, which may not be shocking for you, but it certinaly was for me because up to this I lived either walking or biking distance to work, and anyway "work" was generally something I could do  a lot of from home or from cafes. The routine squeezed me, and in response I began to squeeze the precious lost drops of time from my day.

This happened very close to my emigration to Germany, where an interesting dynamic unfolded. The new work routine was so emotionally exhausting that I had absolutely no interest in having any other routine outside of it. Taking a German class filled me with dread. Without an actual course in German, I spoke more or last random German words I picked up in more or less random arrangements. It was enough to communicate with the baker, and, once, with the police in the train station when I was crying and had pinkeye and needed wifi (they gave me a wifi password, in the end, true story). It was not enough to communicate with my primarily German colleagues.


Both I and my primarily German colleagues began to lightheartedly shame me for not even making an effort to talk to them in German. I had started out with this attitude of "I've been an immigrant before, I got this" but then I just ran out of bright-eyed-bushy-tailed-ness. Again. I wasn't 11 anymore, and there were things in my day, like laundry and meetings about I don't even know what, that sapped the energy that I had imagined unlimited. My German colleagues teased me a little, but I unleashed a thorough program of self-loathing.
* There is a huge difference between moving to the US when I was 11 and moving to Germany when I was 27.

When I was 11 and came to the US, I had just read Harry Potter Book 1. It took me forever, I pronounced the word "blood" with an "ooh" sound in my head the whole time. My classmates had a Pittsburgh dialect and I just had absolutely no idea what was going on for 2-3 years and stuck only to other internation students who also spoke slowly and with their hands. My comprehension in English was abominable, but I had a strong sense of vocabulary and considerable intuition for grammar. Later, in high school, I studied Latin for 4 years, and came to truly appreciate what grammar actually was, and how much I didn'T think about any of that stuff in English, even when my accent was obvious and my phrasing was peculiar.

When I was 27 and came to Germany, I had been "studying" German on Duolingo for 5-15 minutes a day (not without periods of interruption) for a few months. That overlapped with the months when I was writing my dissertaiton, so, again, I had this very adult preoccupation that was a wall which the learning of new complexities struggled to penetrate.

The Take-Away

In that 2014 paper, we write in a basically positive :

TK quote

Learnign without learning. Exposure. Background noise.

MAteriality / mebodiment: writing.

Why are you doing this?
