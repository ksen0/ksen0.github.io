  <h2>Current Work</h2>

  <p>CORESIDENT (2020+, work in progress) is a book-object about the coresident beings in the human body, literal (skin microbes) and figurative (in the imaginative, mythological self-narration as we try to understand the relation of our bodies to the world.)</p>

  <p><img src=CORESIDENT/A.PNG style="border:#bbb solid 1px"></p>
  <p>Cover matter and a scan of one of the spreads of the A5 first draft. <a href=#cores>More about the project...</a></p>

<h3>COHERENT UNIT (with Posture and Direction)<br>Precious Life-Saving Trash Sculptures of/for 2020</h3>
<p><img src="COHERENT UNIT.png"></p>

<p>I kept saying for years,, “i should make more sculptures” and when I said it I wasn’t imagining creating precious little trash creatures. Each of three (3) sub-units was composed in May-June as an of exorcism of unresolved and unresolvable energy.</p>

<p>Burnt matches, broken guitar strings, discarded notebook spiral, thread, paper.</p>

<p>Notes from one of the #coherentunitsculptures , constructed in May: “the outcome of fishing a discarded piece of spiral bound notebook wire out of the recycling and re-articulating it: smoothing out its kinks, partitioning it, binding it, adorning it. Constructing a coherent unit from it, with a posture (it is sitting) and a direction (it is facing me) and from that arising perhaps a desire (it wants to be my friend). It wasn’t my trash and it isn’t my friend, but, nevertheless, through my acts, it has posture and direction.”</p>

<h3><a name=cores></a>CORESIDENT (2020+)</h3>
<p>In working on CORESIDENT, I draw on literature on body-mind centering; butoh; and contemporary research on human skin microbial communities and their function in immunity. Researching skin from each of these fields allows interrogating the conception of skin as an essential inside/outside boundary: and the ideas of inside and outside altogether. Anatomical elemtns informed by Human Anatomy Atlas 2021.</p>

  <p><img src=CORESIDENT/B.PNG></p>
  <p>The book-object includes a set of transparency slides - the constellations at the different layers of skin.</p>

   <p><img src=CORESIDENT/C.PNG></p>
    <p>The image of a disembodied / dislocated skin-object is a digitally-edited photograph of one of several dislocated objects made (as a meditation on the filth of skin-layers) our of rice paper, flour, and various seeds and grains.</p>

   <p><img src=CORESIDENT/D.PNG></p>
      <p>A few sketches and exploration of the infested skin-object mythology.</p>

     <p><img src=CORESIDENT/E.PNG></p>
        <p>The internal body is considered through the lens of demonic symmetry. One of the spreads of the book includes a mirror material, slicing the rendering in half. The rendering includes the spine, and the kidneys and liver, associated with the water element, and engaged in the flow of essential energy (kidneys) and filtration of toxins (bladder).</p>

<h2>Color Studies in Digital-Analog Conversations</h2>

<p><em><small>Selections and texts from my residency at Kreativ Kollektive in Feb 2020.</small></em></p>

    <p><img src="UNSAY/1A.JPG" style="width:32%">&nbsp;<img src="UNSAY/1B.JPG" style="width:32%">&nbsp;<img src="UNSAY/1C.JPG" style="width:32%"></p>

<p>I saw a photo of beans someone had harvested and was just stunned by how colorful and complex and gorgeous they were! You can see the original watercolor in the last panel, and the rest is an iterative grid kind of method that I like: a way to take a soft analog work and dissect it digitally. As I worked on this, I was also reading "The Lonely City." There is a very moving story there about Any Warhol thatmade me realize how little I knew of his work and how narrowly I had seen it before. In the book, Olivia Laing makes the case that Warhol's visual repetitions of mundane objects are a ritual, a form of self-care, a way to create order and familiarity. I lived in Pittsburgh (Warhol's birthplace) for 6 years and saw his work (in a special Warhol museum) in so many school trips and finally, so many years later, I felt connection to it, and to the other stories of queer artists navigating their worlds through art-making.</p>

<p>Since only a few months, I've been using colors! All of them, as you can see, at the same time, basically. Here are some of my favorite digital collages of scans of ink, watercolor, and color pencil sketches. There is a basic set of forms that recurs in my work for many years: hands and the closed dreaming-eye most commonly. The hands mean something like creative capability. The dreaming-eye - softness, imagination, peace.</p>
