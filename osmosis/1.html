<h2>Front</h2>
            
      <p><label for="mn-figure-1" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="mn-figure-1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote"><img src="1_front.jpg"/>Front cover</p>
<p>The perfect cup of coffee is the one not used as a performance-enhancing drug.</p>
            
<h2>Time</h2>
            <p>page 1 page 2</p>

<p>Time has a way of expanding and contracting around you. If you often feel like you have no idea where time goes, maybe you could use better tools for (1) articulating your hopes and goals and (2) reflecting on your progess.</p>
            
<h2>Elightenment</h2>
<p>page 3 page 4</p>
            <p>Step 1: Awareness</p>
<p>Step 2: Non-Judgment</p>
<p>Step 3: Englightenment</p>

<p>Just because you can decompose it into a set of steps does not reduce its fundamental enormity. (Enormity is ok.)</p>

<h2>Creavivity</h2>
<p>page 5 page 6</p>
            
<p>Research on creativity reflects duality of joy and torture. The art of making can be both deeply satisfying, nourishing, and engrossing, but also has a high co-incidence with emotional suffering.</p>
            
<p><em>Flow</em> is best achieved when there the right combination of <em>challenge</em> and <em>skill</em>: hard enough not to be bored, not so hard as to be overwhelmed.</p>
            
<p>No one has ever written, painted, sculpted, modeled, built, or invented except literally to get out of hell. ― Antonin Artaud</p>
            
            <p>To consistently get into the flow state, it's necessary to cultivate skills in articulating goals (see page TK) and reflecting on progress (see page TK).</p>
            <p>Meditation may help build concentration skills necessary for flow, as well as to cope with possible emotional overwhelm of creativity or inspiration (see page TK).</p>

<h2>Execution</h2>
<p>page 7 page 8</p>
            
      <p><label for="mn-figure-1" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="mn-figure-1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote"><img src="1_execution.JPG"/>"Execution" spread (prior to the text)</p>
            
<p>At a startup weekend event, a guy - who had just finished off a beer and got started on a redbull - told me "ideas are cheap, execution is everything." I craved wisdom so I took it to heart, and it's been a good guide. Having ideas and starting things is much easier than doing the work [Do the Work] and adapting to constraints, context, and feedback [Founders].</p>
    
            <p>Especially for feedback, I recommend lowering the stakes and being open. For best feedback, things must be just refined enough: to demonstrate the details you want help with, but not more. Also, people can be feel more free to critique when given options between which to compare, which helps them feel less like they are insulting your hard work.</p>
    
            
<h2>Meditation</h2>
            <p>page 9</p>
      <p><label for="mn-figure-1" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="mn-figure-1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote"><img src="1_silh.jpg"/>Matter for "Enlightenment" and "Meditation" Spreads</p>

<p>Busy-ness can be an escape from the pain that becomes apparent (& unbearable) in moments of quiet.</p>    
<p>"Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms—to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way." ― Victor Frankl</p>

<p>Being still is a skill<br>but it's really a thrill<br>to be peaceful at will<br><em>(so I'd argue it's well worth the trouble)</em></p>
<p>Crafting a place of refuge within yourself, cultivating peace, takes patience and persistence. Formal practice (meditating) helps build the skill for everyday, informal practice (creating a healing moment of peace after a long day on a crowded bus; finding inspiration in everything; focusing on a task and not getting distracted; etc)</p>
