h1. {{ page.title }}

p(meta). Ongoing since Spring 2014.

The ocean is an incredible frontier for scientists who study its geology, biology, chemistry, and physics.
Sensors generate treasure-troves of data, making standardization, collaboration, and analysis even more
difficult. My dissertation is on adoption - and adaptation - of data science in oceanography. See short
