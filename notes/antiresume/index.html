    <p class="subtitle"><small><small>In response to the <a href=https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/03/24/umberto-eco-antilibrary/>concept of anti-library and anti-resume, via Umberto Eco and Maria Popova</a>. <br>Last Updated: Dec 22, 2016</small></small></p>

<li>Regular-basis comic creation!</li>
<!--<li>Create, iterate on, and use in a reasonable context a language designed to communicate perceptual shifts and distortions, which is spoken by a race of beings who are intelligent, but live in an extremely harsh and catclysmic environment. They survive there because various envrionmental distress cues trigger various states of hibernation or non-response, but these mechanisms - being evolved and imperfect - also mean that throughout normal daily life many events occur that, in humans, would be on par with psychotic breaks or panic attacks: brain chemicals and hormones gone haywire. BEcuase of their harsh conditions, they have no instruments for seeing, hearing, or vocalizing in the human sense, but they can grown an arbitrary set of disposable limbs, and communicate through electrical current across these limbs when they are in contact with other creatures. The "language" therefore can best be visualized as a field of movements.</li>-->

</ul>
