  <span class="first">F</span>ictional science uses a collective-daydream of a fictional world a vehicle for talking about topics that are both important and difficult to discuss: how our cities can become more sustainable, how our infrastructures can support more people and more migrant people from areas that will be devastated by climate change; how to deal with that devastation. These are not things to be taken lightly, or to be made light, but the purpose of science fiction, at its best, is to make a space where the unsayable things can be discussed.
<br><br>
There is an abundance  of current research that should be part of this conversation but it is not easy to access. More notably, it is not easy to access the relevant research on geoengineering and on sociotechnical infrastructures and on labor laws and on research to create more sustainable food sources and on humanitarian/disaster response policy and robotics and overfishing and and and. Climate change presents a massive-scale systemic problem and effective scientific communication is hard enough when youâ€™re only talking about one discipline.
<br><br>
This project creates a weird little ivory tower, in a strange land in space, with very few scientists sitting in it - which means they have to make sense of many of these overlapping systems at once. They write to each other, and to people back on earth, and they think about what they see in their alien world in relation to what they know from earth. This happens in a post-universal basic income, post-massive, catastrophic climate change world, and the articles they write reflect that. The engineering and scientific practices reflect a more equitable and fair creative process. By inhabiting the imaginary existences of these imaginary scholars, the reader-<em>become</em>-writer-<em>become</em>-philosopher can maintain enough critical distance from the very serious subject matter to still engage with it, synthesize it, learn from it.

<strong>Figure 1 (a,b,c): Terrain Variation Surrounding the Great Geode Valley.</strong>  Imagine you're standing on cracked, dense earth <em>(1a)</em>. But it's not earth, it's rocks, and the cracks extend a meter, two meters, maybe three down. They are dense with growth, of which just a little peeks out. If you get down on your knees you'll notice you can smell it, and it smells thick and sticky like a garden in July. But it's not July. You're not home. You're very far away. There is a dry wind that sways rocks that float <em>(1c)</em> on the thick air oozing from an endless chasm of shimmering crystals <em>(1b)</em>.<br><br><em><small>Watercolor Painting by Victoria Downing</small></em>

  <strong>Figure 2: Interactive illustraction of the beginning conversation sequence.</strong> In those cracks under your feet <em>(Fig. 1a)</em>, a conversation unfolds. There are sentient beings behind these rocky walls which induce the growth of plants between them. Each can influence the way the weeds grow, and how fast they die. Each can perceive the patterns in the weeds. They look at how the plants branch. When they talk, they co-create the conversation; imagine, at every turn, you know what you said, or you know what you didn't say, but, quickly, that becomes immaterial.
